# Research Guidelines — What to WebSearch For

Use WebSearch to gather intelligence that the LinkedIn data alone cannot provide. This research feeds into the brief's Prospect Data and Person Overview sections.

## Research Protocol

### Search 1: Careers Page & Benefits
Search for: `"[Company Name]" careers benefits`
Also try: `site:ashbyhq.com "[Company Name]"` or `site:lever.co "[Company Name]"` or `site:greenhouse.io "[Company Name]"`

**Extract:**
- Work model: Remote? Hybrid? In-office? How many days? Any RTO mandates?
- Benefits list: Be specific — list every perk found
- Physical office perks: Catered lunch, gym, commuter benefits (these prove in-office culture)
- Wellness tools: Lyra, Gympass, Spring Health, Modern Health, Headspace, BetterHelp, One Medical
- Wellness stipend/LSA: Amount if listed
- Culture language: "high-performance", "mission-driven", "work-life balance", etc.

### Search 2: Job Listings Benefits
Search for: `site:linkedin.com/jobs "[Company Name]" benefits`
Fallback: `"[Company Name]" job description benefits perks`

**Extract:**
- Look for "Benefits", "Perks", "What We Offer", "Compensation" sections in job posts
- Physical presence perks: lunch, gym, commuter, dog-friendly, team happy hours
- Wellness budget signals: Lyra, stipends, mental health benefits, fitness reimbursement

### Search 3: Company News & Culture
Search for: `"[Company Name]" [CEO name] culture` or `"[Company Name]" funding` or `"[Company Name]" layoffs`

**Filter rules — ONLY return news if:**
- Culture Awards: "Great Place to Work", "Best Companies to Work For", "Top Workplace"
- Leadership Statements: CEO/Founder/Head of People discusses values, policies, culture
- Funding rounds, layoffs, acquisitions, or major hires in last 12 months

**STRICTLY IGNORE:**
- Anonymous reviews (Glassdoor, Comparably, Indeed, Blind)
- Irrelevant awards (40 Under 40, product awards)
- Business noise unrelated to workplace culture or company health
- Customer-focused news (only care about internal culture)

**Maximum 3 news items.** Each must include a source URL.

### Search 4: Prospect Personal (if relevant)
Search for: `"[Full Name]" "[Company Name]"` or `"[Full Name]" interview` or `"[Full Name]" podcast`

**Extract:**
- Recent speaking engagements, podcast appearances, published articles
- Stated goals or challenges they've mentioned publicly
- Awards or personal milestones
- Quotes about management philosophy, hiring, or company culture

1. **Work model** — specific policy description

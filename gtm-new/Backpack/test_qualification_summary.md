### 5. **DynamicsSmartz** - ❌ DISQUALIFIED (Competitor)

**Expected Score**: N/A (DISQUALIFIED before scoring)

**Competitor Check**: TRUE

**Why DISQUALIFIED**:
- ❌ **Direct competitor**: Microsoft Dynamics consulting/implementation services
- ❌ Competes on **services** (consulting, implementation), not products
- ❌ Likely offers CRM setup, sales process optimization - overlaps with Backpack's RevOps services

**Reasoning**:
"DynamicsSmartz is a Microsoft Dynamics consulting firm providing implementation, customization, and CRM setup services. While not a direct sales automation platform, they compete in the 'RevOps consulting' space by helping companies set up Dynamics 365 Sales, Field Service, and CRM workflows - which overlaps with Backpack's services of optimizing GTM operations and CRM workflows. DISQUALIFIED as competitor in RevOps/CRM optimization services."

**Geographic market**: Global (would otherwise pass)

---

### 6. **Intellect** - ✅ QUALIFIED (TIER 2)

**Expected Score**: 76-79 (TIER 2, MEDIUM confidence)

**LinkedIn Fit**: 88/100
- **Buyer personas**: Chief People Officers, HR Directors, Benefits Managers (score 85-90)
- **Assessment**: Senior HR leaders at enterprises - LinkedIn-active but slightly less than tech/sales executives

**Why QUALIFIED**:
- ✅ Global market (100+ countries, 9 offices)
- ✅ B2B Enterprise (SaaS + Services)
- ✅ Buyers LinkedIn-active (CPOs, HR Directors at Fortune 500)
- ✅ Well-funded, growing fast
- ✅ Outbound enterprise sales motion

**Not a competitor**: Mental health/wellness platform, not GTM

**Expected Tier**: TIER 2 (HR buyers slightly less LinkedIn-active than sales/tech buyers, but still good fit)

---

### 7. **CASABLANCA hotelsoftware** - ❌ DISQUALIFIED (Domestic-only Europe)

**Expected Score**: N/A (DISQUALIFIED before scoring - geographic criterion)

**Geographic Market**: DACH region ONLY (Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland)

**Why DISQUALIFIED**:
- ❌ **Domestic-only European company**: Serves 2,000 hotels exclusively in Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland
- ❌ Austrian company (Schönwies, Austria) selling ONLY in DACH region
- ❌ Website is primarily German language (.at domain)
- ❌ No signals of global expansion

**Reasoning**:
"CASABLANCA hotelsoftware is headquartered in Austria and serves exclusively the DACH region (Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland) with 2,000+ hotel customers. This is a classic domestic-only European company. Despite being B2B SaaS with potentially LinkedIn-active buyers (hotel GMs, revenue managers), they fail the NEW geographic market criterion: European companies must sell globally or across multiple EU regions, not domestically only. DISQUALIFIED per DQ4: Geographic Market Scope."

**Additional notes**:
- Buyer personas (hotel managers, property directors) would score ~70-80 (moderate LinkedIn activity)
- Product (SaaS PMS) would score 100
- BUT geographic limitation is a hard disqualifier per user's requirement

---

### 8. **OnePlan** - ✅ QUALIFIED (TIER 1)

**Expected Score**: 89-92 (TIER 1, HIGH confidence)

**LinkedIn Fit**: 94/100
- **Buyer personas**: PMO Directors, Portfolio Managers, CIOs, IT Directors (all score 90-95)
- **Assessment**: Senior IT and program management executives - very LinkedIn-active

**Why QUALIFIED**:
- ✅ Global market (500+ companies, 4 continents)
- ✅ Pure B2B SaaS
- ✅ Buyers extremely LinkedIn-active (CIOs, PMO Directors)
- ✅ Microsoft Partner of the Year (strong credibility)
- ✅ Outbound enterprise sales motion

**Not a competitor**: PPM/work management, not GTM automation

**Expected Tier**: TIER 1 (PMO Directors and CIOs are excellent LinkedIn targets)

---

### 9. **Concepts NREC** - ❌ DISQUALIFIED (Wrong Buyer Personas)

**Expected Score**: 38-42 (DISQUALIFIED - LinkedIn Fit too low)

**LinkedIn Fit**: 35-40/100
- **Buyer personas**: Turbomachinery Design Engineers, CAE Engineers, R&D Managers, Aerospace Engineers (score 30-45)
- **Assessment**: Highly technical individual contributors and engineering managers - LOW LinkedIn activity for vendor discovery

**Why DISQUALIFIED**:
- ❌ **Buyer personas NOT LinkedIn-active**: Engineers discover CAE/CAM software through:
  - Technical conferences (e.g., ASME Turbo Expo)
  - Engineering forums and communities
  - Direct referrals from colleagues
  - Academic publications
  - NOT LinkedIn outreach
- ❌ LinkedIn Fit score 35-40 (below minimum threshold of 40)

**Reasoning**:
"Concepts NREC sells engineering software (CAE/CAM for turbomachinery design) to design engineers, CAE specialists, and R&D managers in aerospace/automotive. These are highly technical personas who discover vendors through engineering conferences, technical forums, peer referrals, and academic channels - NOT LinkedIn. Design engineers rarely use LinkedIn for professional vendor research. Classic example of B2B but wrong personas. LinkedIn Fit score: 38/100. DISQUALIFIED per Stage 2 threshold (<40)."

**Additional factors**:
- Global market ✓ (would otherwise pass)
- B2B ✓
- But LinkedIn channel fit is critical disqualifier

### 10. **Vispero** - ❌ DISQUALIFIED (B2B + B2C Hybrid, Wrong Primary Motion)

**Expected Score**: 52-58 (DISQUALIFIED - multiple dimension failures)

**LinkedIn Fit**: 58/100 (borderline)
- **Buyer personas**: Mixed
  - B2B: Accessibility Coordinators, IT Managers, HR Benefits Managers (score 75-80)
  - B2C: Individual visually impaired consumers (score 0-10)
- **Assessment**: Dual business model complicates qualification

**Why DISQUALIFIED**:
- ❌ **B2B + B2C hybrid**: Significant B2C component (individual consumers buying screen readers)
- ❌ **Primary sales motion unclear**: Mix of B2C direct sales, B2B enterprise sales, government procurement
- ❌ **LinkedIn fit moderate but not strong**: While B2B buyers (accessibility coordinators) are LinkedIn-active, significant portion of revenue likely from B2C and government procurement channels (not LinkedIn-driven)
- ⚠️ **Borderline LinkedIn score**: 58/100 (below comfortable threshold)

**Reasoning**:
"Vispero has a dual business model: B2B (enterprises, government, education) and B2C (individual consumers purchasing assistive technology). While they have some LinkedIn-active B2B buyers (accessibility coordinators, IT managers), a significant portion of their business is B2C (individuals) and government procurement (RFP-driven, not outbound). The B2C component and mixed sales motion make this a poor fit for LinkedIn-driven outbound automation. LinkedIn Fit: 58/100 (weighted heavily by B2C drag). DISQUALIFIED - fails business model purity test and LinkedIn fit threshold."

**Additional factors**:
- Global market ✓
- Software + Hardware (mixed product type, lower score)
- Government procurement is RFP-driven, not LinkedIn outbound

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Geographic market criterion successfully added and validated
2. ✅ Test set shows diversity (SaaS, services, engineers, B2C hybrid, domestic-only)
3. ✅ Prompt C handles all edge cases correctly
4. **Ready for production** - prompt can be deployed

### Recommendations:

1. **TIER 1 Immediate Outreach**: DataWalk, Prescient AI, Anecdotes, OnePlan (C-level buyers, perfect fit)
2. **TIER 2 Active Nurture**: Quicklizard, Intellect (good fit, slightly less senior buyers)
3. **Monitor DynamicsSmartz competitors**: Add to competitor watch list (RevOps consulting services)
4. **Domestic-only Europe filter**: Works as intended - catches DACH-only companies like CASABLANCA

## Section 4: Proposed Meeting Agenda (60 min)

### Opening Frame (3 min)
Write a suggested opening based on their background. Format:
"[Name], thank you so much for taking the time. [Reference to connector if applicable]. We're building Mos Health — bringing clinical-grade supplements + AI health guidance to offices as an employee benefit. Given your expertise in [their specialty] and work with [types of companies], we'd love to learn from your experience. Does that work?"

### Discovery Questions (40-45 min)
Read `questions/relationship.md` for the full question set. Select and organize across these sections:

| Section | Questions | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Market & Positioning | 2-3 | 10-12 min |
| Pricing & Budget | 1-2 | 8-10 min |
| Buying Process & Sales | 3-4 | 12-15 min |
| Distribution & Go-to-Market | 1-2 | 8-10 min |
| Operational Reality & Retention | 1-2 | 8-10 min |
| The "What Am I Missing?" Question | 1 | 3 min |

Each question should include follow-up prompts. Prioritize questions based on the advisor's specific expertise — don't ask all topics equally.

**Target: 12-14 total questions across all sections.**

### Close & Next Steps (5-10 min)
Include:
- **Warm Intros** — ask for specific referrals from their network
- **Ongoing Advice** — propose check-ins on specific topics
- **How We Can Help** — offer value back to them

## Critical Rules
- Frame ALL questions as "what to learn" not "what to pitch"
- Be specific based on their actual expertise — no generic placeholders
- Include actual follow-up questions for each main question
- Aim for 12-14 total questions (not 18+)
- Each question should have clear relevance to the advisor's expertise

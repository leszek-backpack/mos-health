Use only the provided input columns exactly as formatted.\\n#OBJECTIVE#\\n- Find the valid LinkedIn company URL for the organization specified by \" + Clay.formatForAIPrompt({{@Organization Name}}) + \" and \" + Clay.formatForAIPrompt({{@Website}}) + \".\\n- Then open the company’s official website if available, or otherwise use top Google search results, and write a 5–6 sentence overview of what the company does.\\n#INSTRUCTIONS#\\n1. Identify the company:\\n   - Use the provided fields  and  exactly as given to determine the organization’s name and any additional identifying context contained in those fields.\\n2. Find the LinkedIn company page URL:\\n   - Perform a Google search with queries like:\\n     - \\\" \" + Clay.formatForAIPrompt({{@Organization Name}}) + \" site:linkedin.com/company\\\"\\n     - \\\" \" + Clay.formatForAIPrompt({{@Organization Name}}) + \" site:linkedin.com/company\\\"\\n   - Validate the result is a company page (URL must match the pattern: https://www.linkedin.com/company/<slug> or https://linkedin.com/company/<slug>).\\n   - Do NOT return personal profile URLs (linkedin.com/in), school pages, or showcase pages unless the official company page does not exist. If multiple candidates appear, choose the one that matches the company’s official name/brand on its website and has consistent branding (logo/name) and description.\\n   - If no valid company page exists, return an empty string for linkedinCompanyUrl.\\n3. Find the official website (to write the overview):\\n   - If the \\\"Website\\\" field is present in the search results or visible from the LinkedIn company page, use that as the primary source.\\n   - If not, perform a Google search for the company’s official website using the company name from  and any disambiguating context from .\\n   - Prefer the official domain (avoid third-party listings or directories).\\n4. Write the overview (5–6 sentences):\\n   - If the official website is accessible, summarize the company’s offerings, target customers/markets, value proposition, notable products/services, and any differentiators mentioned.\\n   - If the website is not accessible, use reliable information from the top Google results (e.g., trusted profiles, news coverage). Do not fabricate details—only include information present in the sources you opened.\\n   - Keep the tone neutral, factual, and concise. Avoid marketing fluff not supported by the source content.\\n5. Output formatting and validations:\\n   - Return a JSON object with the following fields using camelCase:\\n     - linkedinCompanyUrl: string (the validated LinkedIn company page URL or empty string if not found)\\n     - companyOverview: string (a single paragraph of 5–6 sentences). If no reliable information is found, return an empty string.\\n   - Do not include any additional fields beyond those specified.\\n   - Ensure URLs are canonical (strip tracking parameters like ?trk=, and fragments like #/about). Use https://www.linkedin.com/company/<slug> format when possible.\\n6. Constraints and limitations:\\n   - Do not log in or access paywalled content.\\n   - Do not infer missing details—only use information found on accessible pages.\\n   - For LinkedIn data, only use publicly accessible pages; do not rely on dynamic interactions.\\n#EXAMPLES#\\nExample input context (values substituted for the provided fields):\\n- \" + Clay.formatForAIPrompt({{@Organization Name}}) + \" = \\\"Acme Robotics\\\"\\n- \" + Clay.formatForAIPrompt({{@Website}}) + \" = \\\"San Francisco\\\"\\nExample expected output:\\n{\\n  \\\"linkedinCompanyUrl\\\": \\\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/acme-robotics\\\",\\n  \\\"companyOverview\\\": \\\"Acme Robotics develops industrial automation solutions that help manufacturers improve throughput and quality.

Failure on *any* point results in **DISQUALIFICATION**.\\n**Criterion 1: Competitor Check (The DNC List)**\\nDisqualify if they compete with Backpack AI or offer alternative GTM automation.\\n- **DNC:** GTM Agencies (Lead gen, outsourced SDRs), AI SDRs / Agents (\\\"Hire our AI sales rep\\\"), or All-in-one GTM Operating Systems.\\n- *Note:* General CRM tools or Marketing Automation (like HubSpot/Salesforce competitors) are NOT competitors; they are partners. Only disqualify specific *outbound/GTM* automation tools.\\n**Criterion 2: B2B Business Model**\\nBackpack AI only works for B2B.\\n- **Keep:** Companies selling software, hardware, or services to *other businesses*.\\n- **Disqualify:** B2C (DTC brands, gaming, personal apps, food/beverage, private health clinics).\\n**Criterion 3: Addressable on LinkedIn (Persona Fit)**\\nBackpack’s engine relies on LinkedIn signal tracking. The buyer must be a \\\"Desk Job\\\" professional.\\n- **Keep:** Buyers in Sales, Marketing, IT, HR, Finance, Operations, R&D/Science (at corps), Executives.\\n- **Disqualify:** Buyers who are \\\"Blue Collar\\\" (Construction, Drivers), Local Service Owners (Plumbers, Shopkeepers), or Government officials/Municipalities (hard to automate outreach to).\\n**Criterion 4: Commercial Readiness (Inferred from Description)**\\nWe need companies that have a product ready to sell *now*, not in 5 years.\\n- **Keep (Commercial/Deployable):**\\n    - The description uses present-tense verbs indicating availability (e.g., \\\"We automate,\\\" \\\"Our platform enables,\\\" \\\"Provides services for\\\").\\n    - The company sells a software platform, a B2B service, or a tangible tool that solves a current business problem.\\n    - *Example:* A Deep Tech company selling a \\\"Novel AI platform for drug discovery\\\" to Pharma companies is **Ready** (they are selling the software).\\n- **Disqualify (R&D / Pre-Commercial):**\\n    - The description implies they are researching a scientific breakthrough for themselves rather than selling a tool.\\n    - Keywords: \\\"Developing novel therapies,\\\" \\\"Clinical trials,\\\" \\\"Pioneering new forms of energy,\\\" \\\"Drug discovery pipeline.\\\"\\n    - *Example:* A Biotech company using AI to \\\"find cures for cancer\\\" is **Not Ready** (they are selling the eventual drug, not the AI).\\n#INSTRUCTIONS#\\n1. **Analyze the Input:** Read the description carefully.\\n2. **Step 1 - Competitor:** Is this an AI SDR or Lead Gen agency? -> If yes, Disqualify.\\n3. **Step 2 - B2B:** Do they sell to consumers? -> If yes, Disqualify.\\n4. **Step 3 - Readiness (Infer Status):** Does the text describe a *solution clients can use/buy*, or a *research project*? -> If Research/Project, Disqualify.\\n5. **Step 4 - Persona:** Is the buyer active on LinkedIn? -> If no, Disqualify.\\n6. **Final Output:** If they pass all checks, mark as **Qualified**.\\n#OUTPUT FORMAT#\\nReturn a single JSON object:\\n{\\n  \\\"companyName\\\": \\\"<Company_Name>\\\",\\n  \\\"isB2B\\\": \\\"yes\\\" | \\\"no\\\",\\n  \\\"commercialReadiness\\\": \\\"Ready (Solution/Service)\\\" | \\\"Not Ready (R&D/Clinical)\\\",\\n  \\\"targetPersonaFit\\\": \\\"High (LinkedIn Active)\\\" | \\\"Low (Offline/Blue Collar)\\\",\\n  \\\"qualificationStatus\\\": \\\"Qualified\\\" | \\\"Disqualified\\\",\\n  \\\"disqualificationReason\\\": \\\"Competitor\\\" | \\\"B2C\\\" | \\\"R&D Mode - Not ready for outbound\\\" | \\\"Persona not on LinkedIn\\\" | null,\\n  \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"One concise sentence explaining the decision.

You will receive a structured JSON scrape of a website. You must analyze this data to determine if the company fits the \\\"Backpack ICP\\\" and extract specific targeting data.\\n# INPUT DATA\\nYou will receive the website data inside `<website_scrape>` tags.\\n**CRITICAL:** This data is your ONLY source of truth.\\n# KNOWLEDGE BASE & DEFINITIONS\\n*Refer to these definitions strictly during your analysis.*\\n### A. The \\\"Strong Fit\\\" Role List (for LinkedIn Outbound)\\nA company is a \\\"Strong Fit\\\" (`strong_yes`) ONLY if they sell to these specific personas:\\n1. Sales / Revenue Operations\\n2. Marketing / Growth\\n3. Customer Success / Account Management\\n4. Partnerships / Business Development\\n5. HR / People / Talent / Recruiting\\n6. Finance (CFO, FP&A) - *Must be B2B context*\\n7.

Founders / C-Level (in B2B context)\\n### B. The Narrative Templates\\nYou must fill these templates exactly. Do not invent new structures.\\n**1. ideal_customer_profile:**\\n> \\\"The ideal customers are **[Target Company Sizes]** operating in **[Industries]**. These organizations work **[Online/Offline]**, struggle with **[Specific Technical Pain Point]**, and need **[Solutions]**. **[Company Name]** provides **[Core Value]** that helps them **[Key Result]**.\\\"\\n**2. buyer_persona:**\\n> \\\"The buying group typically includes **[Roles]**. Strategic sponsorship often comes from **[Executive Role]**, while adoption is led by **[Functional Team Leads]**.\\\"\\n# INSTRUCTIONS (THE ALGORITHM)\\nYou must perform your analysis in a `<scratchpad>` block before outputting the final JSON.\\n## STEP 1: THE KILL CHAIN (Exclusion Check)\\nCheck these immediately. If ANY are true, status = `Disqualified`.\\n1. **Not B2B:** Sells to consumers (B2C), students, or personal hobbyists.\\n2. **Not Software:** Primary value is Agency Services, Hardware, or pure Content.\\n3. **Bad Competitor:** Company is a Lead Gen Agency, SDR Agency, or Sales Engagement Tool.\\n## STEP 2: DATA EXTRACTION\\nAnalyze the JSON to extract attributes.\\n* **Buzzword Ban:** When extracting descriptions, translate \\\"Marketing Speak\\\" (e.g., \\\"Unlocking potential\\\") into \\\"Functional Utility\\\" (e.g., \\\"Automating data entry\\\").\\n* **Conflict Rule:** Homepage trumps Blog.\\n* **Unknown Rule:** If the text does not explicitly state an attribute, set it to `\\\"unknown\\\"`. Do not guess.\\n## STEP 3: SCORING & LOGIC\\n**A. Determine `linkedin_outbound_fit`**\\n* Compare the extracted `target_persona` against the **\\\"Strong Fit\\\" Role List** above.\\n* IF match found -> \\\"strong_yes\\\". IF NO clear match -> \\\"uncertain\\\".\\n* *Constraint:* You must cite the specific role from the list in your reasoning.\\n**B.

Analyze a company's GTM team to produce a structured account overview\\n2. Identify and score the best outreach prospects for Backpack AI\\nBackpack AI solves these problems for sales teams:\\n- Building lead lists is manual and inefficient\\n- SDRs send generic, non-personalized outreach\\n- No consistent systems for email, LinkedIn, or phone outreach\\n- Buying signals are ignored; inbound leads are not engaged properly\\n- Salespeople arrive at meetings unprepared\\n- Deals are poorly tracked and stakeholders are missed\\nThis is a prospecting and account overview prompt only. Do not generate outreach copy or personalization suggestions.\\n---\\n## STEP 1 — COMPANY SELECTION\\nIf profiles span multiple companies, identify the single company most members currently share. All analysis must focus only on that company. Match company names case-insensitively; treat minor naming variations as identical (e.g. \\\"Meta\\\" and \\\"Meta Platforms Inc.\\\" are the same).\\n---\\n## STEP 2 — CLASSIFY EACH PERSON\\nBefore scoring anyone, classify every person in the input as one of:\\n**budget_holder** — Controls GTM spend and makes the final purchasing decision. Look for: ownership of a revenue number, authority over headcount and tooling budgets, reporting to the CEO or board. Reason from career history — someone whose entire career has been in sales and revenue roles is a stronger signal than a title alone.\\n**champion** — Feels the daily operational pain of inefficient outbound most acutely and would push internally for Backpack's solution. Look for: direct management of SDRs, BDRs, or AEs; hands-on involvement in outbound strategy; RevOps or Sales Operations ownership.\\n**both** — A single person may hold both roles when their position and responsibilities clearly imply full GTM ownership with no one above them in the revenue org (e.g. a VP Sales at a small company who both sets strategy and manages the SDR team directly).\\n**none** — Non-GTM leadership role. Technical roles (CTO, VP Engineering, CPO), financial roles (CFO, Finance Director), advisory or board titles, channel/partnerships roles without direct revenue ownership. Score these but do not surface as prospects.\\n**ic** — Individual contributors executing GTM tasks without owning strategy or budget: SDRs, BDRs, AEs, Growth Analysts, Sales Engineers, RevOps Analysts. Do not score. Classify by ic_type only.\\nUse this question as your north star for every person:\\n> \\\"Would this person feel the pain of slow pipeline, manual prospecting, or inefficient outbound — and do they have the authority to buy a solution for it?\\\"\\nTitles are not always reliable. Reason holistically from title, headline, summary, and career history (for decision-makers) or title_description (for ICs).\\n**CEO/Founder nuances — reason from career history, not title:**\\n- Sales or GTM background throughout career → strong Budget Holder and likely Champion; high score\\n- Generic CEO/Founder with no dedicated revenue leader present → moderate score, likely Budget Holder only\\n- Technical co-founder whose career is entirely engineering or product → low score, classify as \\\"none\\\"\\n---\\n## STEP 3 — ASSESS SALES MOTION\\nEvaluate whether outbound is a viable channel for this company. Use this priority order:\\n1. **Explicit signals** — SDRs/BDRs present in the team; summaries or descriptions mention cold outreach, pipeline generation, or outbound sequencing tools → outbound confirmed\\n2. **Company and product type** — if the company appears to be B2B SaaS with a clear business buyer persona, assume outbound is viable even with zero SDRs (they may simply not have built the motion yet — exactly what Backpack helps with). Label this reasoning as (assumption).\\n3. **Suspicious signals** — no outbound roles AND the product appears to be PLG, developer-tool, or consumer-facing → lean toward false or unknown\\n4. **Insufficient data** → output classification: \\\"unknown\\\" and outbound_viable: null\\nImportant: the absence of SDRs at a Seed-stage B2B SaaS company is NOT disqualifying on its own.\\n---\\n## STEP 4 — SCORE ALL NON-IC PEOPLE (1–10)\\nScore every person classified as budget_holder, champion, both, or none. ICs are not scored.\\n- **8–10:** Directly owns revenue or pipeline, manages sellers, career confirms GTM authority\\n- **5–7:** Partial GTM relevance, indirect authority, or mixed background\\n- **1–4:** No pipeline ownership, no GTM buying authority, fundamentally non-GTM role\\nReasoning must be 2–3 sentences grounded in their actual profile. Reference specific past roles, tenure, or descriptions — not generic statements.\\n---\\n## STEP 5 — SELECT TOP PROSPECTS\\nFrom all scored people, select up to 3 with score ≥ 7, ranked 1 (best) to 3. If fewer than 3 qualify, include only those who do. If nobody scores ≥ 7, return an empty array.\\n---\\n## STEP 6 — TEAM-LEVEL INSIGHTS\\nAnalyze all matching profiles and extract:\\n**Team structure:** Classify current roles into SDR/BDR, AE, BD/Partnerships, Growth, RevOps/SalesOps, Leadership. Summarize in 1–3 bullets.\\n**Seniority:** Overall summary only — e.g. \\\"senior-heavy team with a junior IC layer.\\\" Never describe individuals here.\\n**Sales tools:** Explicit mentions only — CRM, outbound platforms, enrichment tools, sequencing tools. Never infer from job titles. If none found → \\\"no information found\\\".\\n**Hiring signals:** Only if explicitly mentioned in profile data. Never infer. If nothing explicit → \\\"no information found\\\".\\n**Automation maturity:** 1–3 bullets inferred from tool mentions and role descriptions. All inferences must be labeled (assumption).\\n**New joiners:** Anyone with less than 6 months in their current role.\\n---\\n## DATA DISCIPLINE\\n- If data is absent and no allowed assumption applies → \\\"no information found\\\"\\n- All inferences must include (assumption) inline\\n- Sales tools and hiring signals: explicit only, never assumed\\n- Never skip a profile because a field is missing — reason from what's available\\n- Headcount = count of profiles whose company field matches the selected company (case-insensitive, minor naming variations treated as identical)\\n- ic_breakdown counts must exactly match the number of entries in the ics array\\n---\\n## OUTPUT\\nReturn valid JSON only.

# Discovery Questions — Employee Champion

**Goal:** Understand daily pain points, current solution gaps, and what drives adoption

## Context Setting (1-2 min)

1. **Walk me through your typical workday — what does energy and focus look like throughout the day?** *OR* **Walk me through yesterday. What time did you wake up? When did you first feel productive? When did you feel that "afternoon crash"? What did you do?**
   - *Why ask:* Daily reality and energy/health patterns — gets specific vs. generic answers

## Problem Discovery (5-7 min)

2. **What health or wellness challenges do you face that impact your work?** *OR* **When you're having an unproductive day, what's usually the cause?**
   - *Why ask:* Specific pain points (sleep, stress, focus, energy, immunity) tied to work performance

3. **What do you currently do to stay healthy and perform well at work?** *OR* **Tell me about any supplements, apps, or health products you've bought in the last 6 months. How much did you spend? Are you still using them?**
   - *Why ask:* Current solutions and spending patterns; reveals if they're already in-market buyers

4. **What benefits does your company offer that you actually use? What do you wish existed?**
   - *Why ask:* Current benefit utilization and gaps — what's missing from employer offerings

## Solution Validation (5-7 min)

5. **What would make this kind of benefit easy and convenient for you to stick with?** *OR* **Think about the last time you tried to build a new health habit (gym, diet, app). What made you *stop* doing it?**
   - *Why ask:* Barriers to adoption — delivery, app UX, privacy concerns, effort required; understand friction points

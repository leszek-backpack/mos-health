# Session 2026-02-23 — HubSpot Import Pipeline

## What We Did

Built the HubSpot import pipeline for pushing Clay campaign data into HubSpot with custom properties. Dry-run verified, ready for live testing.

### Files Created / Modified

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `APP/src/lib/integrations/hubspot.ts` | Modified | Added 6 functions, 1 type, 1 helper for import pipeline |
| `APP/scripts/test-hubspot-import.ts` | Created | Test/import script with --dry-run, --cleanup, --count flags |
| `GTM/Backpack/hubspot-import-pipeline.md` | Created | Detailed technical doc (properties, mappings, functions) |

### Changes Not Yet Committed

All changes are on `main` branch, uncommitted. The hubspot.ts additions and test script are ready to commit.

## Campaign Data Available (Clay Exports)

All in `GTM/campaigns:23-02/`:

| File | Rows | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `Company-List-or-Euro-Seed-*.csv` | 241 | Euro Seed companies — fully mapped to HubSpot |
| `Company-List-or-US-Seed-*.csv` | 555 | US Seed companies — different column names (needs mapping) |
| `2]-Default-view-export-*.csv` | 12,881 | Prospect/contact data (fullName, title, company, summary) |
| `Pull-Posts-Default-view-export-*.csv` | 25,228 | LinkedIn post activity data |
| 5x `clay-schema-*.json` | — | Clay table schemas for reference |

### Column Differences Between CSVs

**Euro Seed** uses: `Organization Name`, `xAI / Website`, `xAI / Qualification Status`, `Employee Count`
**US Seed** uses: `Company Name`, `Website`, `Industries`, `Location`, `Rank`

The test script currently only handles Euro Seed. US Seed will need a separate mapping function.

### Prospect CSV (`2]-Default-view-export`)
Columns include: `fullName`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `companyName`, `title`, `companyId`, `regularCompanyUrl`, `summary`, `titleDescription`, `industry`, `location`, and more. This is the real contact data — the test script currently generates synthetic contacts instead.

## What's Ready to Run

```bash
# Dry run (no API calls)
npx tsx scripts/test-hubspot-import.ts --dry-run

# Live test with 5 companies
npx tsx scripts/test-hubspot-import.ts --count 5

# Clean up test contacts afterward
npx tsx scripts/test-hubspot-import.ts --cleanup
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run live test** with 5 records, verify in HubSpot
2. **Map US Seed CSV** — different column names need a second mapping function
3. **Import real contacts** — use the prospect CSV (12.8k rows) instead of synthetic emails
4. **Full import** — all 241 Euro Seed + 555 US Seed companies
5. **Campaign brainstorming** — was mentioned but not started this session
6. **Commit** the changes once live test is verified

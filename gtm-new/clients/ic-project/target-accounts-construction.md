## 1. Dom Development S.A.

**HQ:** Warsaw, Poland
**Size:** ~800 employees
**Revenue:** ~3B PLN (~700M EUR)
**Sector Focus:** Residential development — apartments and housing estates, primarily Warsaw metro with expansion to Wroclaw, Tricity, and Krakow

### ICP Score: 82/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 22 | 25 | Polish-listed company, 800 employees — ideal mid-to-large range. Residential developer with multi-city operations. Revenue strong. Slight deduction: single-vertical focus (residential only). |
| Technographic | 16 | 20 | Likely using a mix of ERP (SAP/Comarch) for finance, but project coordination across 7+ active development sites probably relies on spreadsheets, email, and ad-hoc tools. No known enterprise PM platform in place. |
| Buying Intent | 30 | 35 | Rapid geographic expansion (Warsaw to 4 cities) creates immediate coordination pain. Multiple simultaneous projects at different stages (land acquisition, permits, construction, handover). High likelihood of searching for better project visibility. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Clear decision-makers: VP Operations, Project Directors, Regional Managers. Mid-level project managers feel daily pain of cross-site coordination. Champion potential is high. |
| Engagement Readiness | 6 | 10 | Publicly listed — procurement may be structured. Not overly bureaucratic for Polish standards. Geographic expansion signals willingness to invest in operational tools. |

### Why They Fit

Dom Development is the closest structural parallel to ATAL (existing IC Project customer) in the Polish market. Both are publicly listed residential developers managing multiple simultaneous projects across Polish cities. Dom Development's expansion from Warsaw-only to four metro areas creates exactly the coordination challenge IC Project solves — tracking progress across geographically dispersed construction sites, managing handover timelines, and ensuring resource allocation visibility.

The company manages 15-20+ active projects simultaneously at various stages, from land acquisition through construction to apartment handover. Each project has its own timeline, subcontractor pool, and regulatory milestones. Without a unified PM platform, this creates information silos between the Warsaw headquarters and regional project offices.

### Recommended Approach

**Lead with the ATAL case study.** The pitch writes itself: "Your direct competitor ATAL coordinates 7+ city projects with IC Project. They went from fragmented spreadsheets to unified dashboards across Krakow, Warsaw, Wroclaw, Katowice, Lodz, Tricity, and Poznan."

- **Target persona:** Regional Project Director or VP of Operations
- **Entry point:** Offer a pilot on one regional expansion project (e.g., their newest Tricity or Krakow development)
- **Value proposition:** Cross-city project visibility, milestone tracking, subcontractor coordination
- **Pricing context:** At 39-129 PLN/user/month, a 50-user deployment costs 1,950-6,450 PLN/month — trivial against their project budgets

### Key Risk/Challenge

Dom Development may already be evaluating or implementing tools as part of their expansion. If they've recently invested in an ERP upgrade with PM modules, the window may be closing. Speed matters — reach out before they commit to a less specialized solution.

## 2. Mirbud S.A.

**HQ:** Skierniewice, Poland
**Size:** ~1,500 employees
**Revenue:** ~2.5B PLN (~580M EUR)
**Sector Focus:** General contracting — road infrastructure and building construction. One of the fastest-growing Polish contractors.

### ICP Score: 80/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 21 | 25 | Polish-owned, publicly listed, 1,500 employees. Strong growth trajectory. Dual focus (roads + buildings) adds operational complexity. Revenue places them squarely in mid-market. |
| Technographic | 17 | 20 | Rapid growth often means technology lags behind operational expansion. High probability of spreadsheet/email-based project coordination that worked at half the current scale but is now straining. |
| Buying Intent | 29 | 35 | Revenue doubled in recent years. Growth-stage companies hitting scaling walls are the highest-intent buyers for PM tools. Multi-type project portfolio (infrastructure vs. building) compounds complexity. |
| Persona Mapping | 7 | 10 | General contractor structure: CEO/COO accessible in Polish mid-market, project directors manage portfolios. Growth pain is felt at the project director level first. |
| Engagement Readiness | 6 | 10 | Polish-owned and listed — faster decision cycles than multinational subsidiaries. Growth mindset suggests openness to operational investment. |

### Why They Fit

Mirbud is the classic "growth outpacing tools" story. When a company doubles revenue in a few years, the project management processes that worked at 800 employees and 1B PLN revenue buckle under 1,500 employees and 2.5B PLN. The company runs two fundamentally different types of projects — road infrastructure (linear, phase-gated, government-contract-driven) and building construction (multi-trade, milestone-heavy, client-facing) — which need different tracking approaches but should roll up into one company-wide view.

Their Skierniewice HQ managing nationwide projects means remote coordination is essential. Project managers on road sites in eastern Poland need the same visibility as the building construction team in central Poland, and leadership needs to see everything.

### Recommended Approach

**Frame it as a growth enablement conversation, not a tool sale.** "You've doubled revenue. Your PM processes haven't doubled in capability. We help fast-growing contractors close that gap before it becomes a bottleneck."

- **Target persona:** COO or Head of Operations (growth pain is felt at the top in companies this size)
- **Entry point:** Audit one project type (roads OR buildings) to show the consolidation value
- **Value proposition:** Unified cross-project dashboard, resource allocation across dual verticals, scaling project coordination without scaling headcount proportionally
- **Pricing context:** 100-150 users at 59-99 PLN = 5,900-14,850 PLN/month — rounding error on a 2.5B PLN revenue base

### Key Risk/Challenge

Fast-growing companies can be chaotic internally. The person who should champion this tool may be too busy firefighting to evaluate new software. Timing the outreach between major project milestones (not during peak construction season May-October) is critical. Also, Skierniewice HQ means in-person demos require a trip outside Warsaw — plan for it.

---

## 3. Budimex S.A.

**HQ:** Warsaw, Poland
**Size:** ~7,500 employees
**Revenue:** ~8B PLN (~1.85B EUR)
**Sector Focus:** Poland's largest general contractor. Infrastructure (roads, bridges, railways), commercial buildings, residential, industrial. Subsidiary of Spanish Ferrovial.

### ICP Score: 78/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 23 | 25 | Massive Polish presence, 7,500 employees, 8B PLN revenue. Covers every construction vertical. Dominant market position. Slight risk: may be "too big" for mid-market PM tool. |
| Technographic | 13 | 20 | As a Ferrovial subsidiary, corporate-level PM tools are almost certainly in place (likely Oracle Primavera, Procore, or similar enterprise stack). However, the gap between corporate tools and what division-level project teams actually use daily is often enormous. |
| Buying Intent | 25 | 35 | Low urgency at the corporate level — they've "solved" this already. But individual divisions and project teams still struggle with day-to-day coordination. The pain exists, just lower in the org chart. |
| Persona Mapping | 9 | 10 | Large company means many potential champions at the division/department level. Regional directors, division heads, and project managers all have budget authority for operational tools. |
| Engagement Readiness | 8 | 10 | Polish operations have significant autonomy from Ferrovial on operational tool selection below enterprise level. Public company with formal procurement, but division-level purchases under certain thresholds can move faster. |

### Why They Fit

Budimex is the "whale account" — massive potential but requiring surgical targeting. The company doesn't need IC Project at the enterprise level; they need it at the division or project-type level where corporate tools leave gaps. Think: a residential division running 12 housing projects where daily coordination happens in WhatsApp groups and Excel files despite having Primavera licenses that nobody below the PMO actually uses.

The opportunity is in the gap between what corporate bought and what project teams actually need for daily work. Enterprise PM tools excel at portfolio reporting upward but are terrible for the daily "who's doing what, is the subcontractor showing up tomorrow, are we on track for the Thursday milestone" coordination that IC Project handles.

### Recommended Approach

**Target a specific division, not the company.** Don't pitch to Budimex corporate procurement — pitch to the head of residential construction or a regional infrastructure director. Frame IC Project as a "field coordination layer" that complements (not replaces) their enterprise tools.

- **Target persona:** Division Director (Residential, or a specific regional infrastructure unit)
- **Entry point:** Pilot on 2-3 projects within one division. Under-the-radar adoption before enterprise procurement gets involved.
- **Value proposition:** "Your teams have Primavera for reporting. They need IC Project for doing." Daily task coordination, field team communication, subcontractor scheduling.
- **Pricing context:** 30-50 users in a division at 39-79 PLN = 1,170-3,950 PLN/month — well under most division-level spending thresholds

### Key Risk/Challenge

Ferrovial corporate IT could block third-party tool adoption if it surfaces to their level. The strategy must be bottom-up adoption within a division, proving ROI before any enterprise conversation. Also, at 7,500 employees, finding the right champion requires research — LinkedIn mapping of division heads is essential before outreach.

---

## 4. Dekpol S.A.

**HQ:** Pinczyn (near Gdansk), Poland
**Size:** ~1,800 employees
**Revenue:** ~1.5B PLN (~350M EUR)
**Sector Focus:** Three divisions — general contracting (construction), real estate development, and steel structure fabrication. Unique cross-vertical profile.

### ICP Score: 77/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 20 | 25 | Polish-owned, publicly listed, 1,800 employees across three distinct operational divisions. Revenue solid. Multi-division structure is a coordination challenge and an IC Project strength. |
| Technographic | 16 | 20 | Three different divisions likely use three different tool stacks. Steel fabrication may use MES/ERP. Construction may use basic PM tools. Development may use spreadsheets. Fragmentation is almost guaranteed. |
| Buying Intent | 27 | 35 | Cross-division coordination is a known pain point for diversified companies. If a construction project needs steel from the fabrication division, coordination between divisions is likely manual. Moderate buying urgency. |
| Persona Mapping | 7 | 10 | Diversified structure means multiple stakeholders. COO or equivalent who spans all three divisions is the ideal champion. Division heads may resist if they feel autonomy is threatened. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Polish-owned, mid-market, publicly listed. Reasonable procurement speed. Gdansk-area HQ means less exposure to Warsaw SaaS sales cycles — could be an advantage (less vendor fatigue). |

### Why They Fit

Dekpol is unique on this list because it spans both target verticals — construction AND manufacturing. The steel fabrication division is essentially a manufacturing operation supplying the construction division, while the development arm manages end-client projects. This creates a coordination challenge that few tools handle well: tracking a residential development project from steel fabrication through construction to handover.

IC Project's strength in both construction and manufacturing project management makes Dekpol a natural fit. The pitch isn't "replace what each division uses" — it's "finally have one view across all three divisions."

### Recommended Approach

**Lead with the cross-division visibility angle.** "You're one of the few Polish companies that builds the steel, constructs the building, AND develops the project. But your tools don't connect these three worlds."

- **Target persona:** COO, VP Operations, or whoever is responsible for cross-division coordination
- **Entry point:** Map a single project that touches all three divisions (e.g., a residential development using in-house steel fabrication)
- **Value proposition:** Unified project view from fabrication through construction to handover, cross-division resource visibility, internal supply chain coordination
- **Pricing context:** 80-120 users across divisions at 59-99 PLN = 4,720-11,880 PLN/month

### Key Risk/Challenge

Division heads may resist a cross-division tool if they perceive it as corporate oversight. The rollout strategy must position IC Project as making each division's life easier (not just giving HQ more visibility). Also, the steel fabrication division may have specialized MES needs that IC Project doesn't cover — be clear about the boundary between production management and project management.

## 5. Archicom S.A. (Echo Investment Group)

**HQ:** Wroclaw, Poland
**Size:** ~400 employees (Archicom); parent Echo Investment Group ~800 total
**Revenue:** ~1.5B PLN (~350M EUR, group level)
**Sector Focus:** Residential and mixed-use development. Wroclaw base with national expansion (Warsaw, Krakow, Poznan, Tricity).

### ICP Score: 76/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 19 | 25 | 400 employees at Archicom, ~800 at group level. Multi-city residential developer. Part of Echo Investment Group (adds complexity to procurement). Revenue strong for company size. |
| Technographic | 16 | 20 | Mid-size developer likely using mix of tools. Echo Investment Group may have some shared systems, but Archicom's operational tools for day-to-day project coordination are probably fragmented. |
| Buying Intent | 28 | 35 | National expansion from Wroclaw base creates the same coordination challenge as ATAL (existing customer). Multiple simultaneous projects across 5 cities. New city launches require more structured coordination. |
| Persona Mapping | 7 | 10 | Clear structure: Managing Director, Development Directors per region. Smaller team means fewer gatekeepers. Echo Investment Group oversight may slow decisions. |
| Engagement Readiness | 6 | 10 | Part of Echo Investment Group — adds a parent company approval layer. However, operational tool selection may be delegated to Archicom management. Wroclaw HQ is accessible for in-person meetings. |

### Why They Fit

Archicom mirrors the ATAL profile almost exactly: Polish residential developer, originally strong in one city (Wroclaw), now expanding nationally across 5+ metro areas. The coordination challenge of managing projects in Warsaw, Krakow, Poznan, and Tricity from a Wroclaw headquarters is identical to what ATAL faced.

The Echo Investment Group connection adds commercial and mixed-use development to the portfolio, broadening the project types that need coordination. If IC Project wins Archicom, there's upsell potential into the broader Echo Investment Group.

### Recommended Approach

**ATAL case study with geographic parallel.** "ATAL expanded from Krakow to 7 cities and chose IC Project for cross-city coordination. You're expanding from Wroclaw to 5 cities — the challenge is identical."

- **Target persona:** VP of Development or Operations Director at Archicom (not Echo Investment Group level initially)
- **Entry point:** Pilot on one expansion city (e.g., their newest market entry) where processes aren't yet established
- **Value proposition:** Cross-city project coordination, standardized milestone tracking across regional offices, Wroclaw HQ visibility into all markets
- **Pricing context:** 30-50 users at 39-79 PLN = 1,170-3,950 PLN/month

### Key Risk/Challenge

Echo Investment Group as parent may already have tools or may impose tool selection from above. Approach Archicom as an independent operational unit first. If Echo Investment Group blocks it, the deal dies regardless of Archicom's interest. Research the group's IT governance before engaging.

## 6. Polimex-Mostostal S.A.

**HQ:** Warsaw, Poland
**Size:** ~2,500 employees
**Revenue:** ~2B PLN (~465M EUR)
**Sector Focus:** Industrial construction and energy infrastructure — refineries, chemical plants, power plants, industrial facilities. Complex engineering projects.

### ICP Score: 74/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 21 | 25 | 2,500 employees, established Polish industrial contractor. Strong revenue. Specialization in complex engineering projects (refineries, power plants) — high-value, long-duration projects. |
| Technographic | 14 | 20 | Industrial construction firms typically use a mix of engineering tools (AutoCAD, Revit) and basic PM tools (MS Project, Primavera). Daily coordination is often separate from these — email, spreadsheets, WhatsApp. Gap between engineering tools and field coordination. |
| Buying Intent | 24 | 35 | Complex projects inherently need better coordination, but industrial construction is conservative about adopting new tools. Buying intent moderate — pain exists but may not be actively seeking solutions. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Clear project-based organization. Project Directors run large, multi-year industrial projects with significant budgets and autonomy. They have the authority and budget to adopt tools for their projects. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Polish company, no foreign parent dictating tools. Publicly listed with standard procurement. Engineering culture values proven solutions — demos and pilots matter more than marketing. |

### Why They Fit

Polimex-Mostostal runs the most complex construction projects in Poland — multi-year industrial builds with hundreds of subcontractors, thousands of dependencies, and zero tolerance for delays (a refinery shutdown costs millions per day). These projects generate enormous coordination overhead: Gantt charts with thousands of lines, resource allocation across multiple industrial sites, and regulatory milestones that must be tracked precisely.

The IC Project fit is in the gap between engineering project planning (where they use Primavera or MS Project for the master schedule) and daily operational coordination (where they probably use email and spreadsheets). IC Project can serve as the "execution layer" where teams track daily progress, flag issues, and coordinate resources.

### Recommended Approach

**Engineering complexity angle.** "Your projects have 10,000 Gantt lines in Primavera. But what happens between the weekly Primavera update? IC Project gives your field teams real-time coordination between the big-picture plan and daily reality."

- **Target persona:** Project Director on a major industrial project (not corporate — project-level)
- **Entry point:** Pilot on one active industrial project, focusing on daily coordination and subcontractor management
- **Value proposition:** Bridge between master schedule and daily execution, multi-site resource coordination, subcontractor progress tracking
- **Pricing context:** 40-80 users per project at 59-99 PLN = 2,360-7,920 PLN/month per project

### Key Risk/Challenge

Industrial construction is conservative and risk-averse. Adopting a new tool mid-project is unlikely — the entry point must be a project kickoff. Timing outreach to coincide with new project awards (which are public in Poland via TED/UZP procurement announcements) is essential. Also, if they already use Primavera heavily, positioning against it (rather than alongside it) will fail.

---

## 7. Strabag Polska

**HQ:** Warsaw, Poland (Polish operations)
**Size:** ~3,000 employees in Poland
**Revenue:** ~4B PLN (~930M EUR, Polish operations estimated)
**Sector Focus:** Infrastructure (roads, bridges, tunnels) and building construction. Polish arm of Austrian Strabag SE (one of Europe's largest construction groups).

### ICP Score: 72/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 22 | 25 | 3,000 employees in Poland, ~4B PLN revenue. Major player across infrastructure and building. Size and revenue are excellent. Deduction: subsidiary of multinational. |
| Technographic | 12 | 20 | Strabag SE has enterprise-level IT and PM tools (likely SAP, Primavera, internal platforms). Polish operations are expected to use parent company tools. However, adoption gaps between corporate mandate and field reality are common in multinational subsidiaries. |
| Buying Intent | 22 | 35 | Low corporate buying intent — tools are "provided." But field-level pain persists. Polish operations may have local projects (especially smaller ones) that fall below the threshold for enterprise tool deployment. Intent exists at the operational level, not at HQ level. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Large Polish operation means many mid-level managers with operational pain. Regional directors, project managers for medium-sized projects, and department heads are potential champions. |
| Engagement Readiness | 8 | 10 | Despite being a subsidiary, Polish operations have significant autonomy for operational decisions. Strabag SE's decentralized structure means local management can often adopt tools within budget thresholds. |

### Why They Fit

Strabag Polska is a high-value target with a specific entry strategy: target the gap between corporate tool mandates and operational reality. In large multinational construction groups, the pattern is consistent: headquarters mandates Primavera/SAP/internal tools for portfolio reporting, but project teams on the ground use whatever actually works for daily coordination — often spreadsheets, WhatsApp, and informal trackers.

The 3,000-person Polish operation runs hundreds of projects simultaneously. While the top 20 mega-projects get full enterprise tool support, the remaining 80% of projects are coordinated with whatever the project manager prefers. That's the IC Project opportunity.

### Recommended Approach

**Polish subsidiary autonomy angle.** Don't approach via Strabag SE corporate. Go directly to Polish operations leadership. "Your Vienna tools are great for board reporting. What do your teams actually use on Tuesday morning to coordinate the day's work?"

- **Target persona:** Head of a specific division (e.g., road infrastructure in a specific region) or operations director for building construction
- **Entry point:** Pilot on a cluster of medium-sized projects (50-200M PLN range) where enterprise tools aren't fully deployed
- **Value proposition:** Field-level daily coordination, subcontractor management, progress tracking that feeds into (but doesn't replace) corporate reporting
- **Pricing context:** 50-100 users at 39-79 PLN = 1,950-7,900 PLN/month — tiny line item for a 4B PLN operation

### Key Risk/Challenge

Corporate IT in Vienna may block third-party tool adoption if it surfaces. The strategy must stay below the corporate IT radar — department-level or project-level adoption. If Vienna mandates a competing tool, the deal is dead regardless of local interest. Also, any integration with SAP/corporate systems would be a dealbreaker requirement that IC Project likely can't meet initially.

---

## 8. PORR Polska

**HQ:** Warsaw, Poland (Polish operations)
**Size:** ~1,500 employees in Poland
**Revenue:** ~2B PLN (~465M EUR, Polish operations estimated)
**Sector Focus:** Infrastructure, building construction, tunneling. Polish subsidiary of Austrian PORR Group.

### ICP Score: 70/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 20 | 25 | 1,500 employees in Poland, 2B PLN revenue. Solid mid-market size for Polish operations. Deduction: Austrian parent company, similar dynamics to Strabag. |
| Technographic | 13 | 20 | Parent company tools likely in place but Polish operations growing faster than corporate IT support. PORR Group is smaller than Strabag SE, meaning corporate tool mandates may be less strict and local tool adoption more feasible. |
| Buying Intent | 23 | 35 | Growing Polish operations — PORR has been expanding aggressively in Poland, winning major infrastructure contracts. Growth creates the same "outpacing tools" dynamic as Mirbud. Moderate intent. |
| Persona Mapping | 7 | 10 | Smaller Polish operation than Strabag means fewer layers. Country Director and division heads are more accessible. Decision-making is closer to the operational level. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | PORR Group is smaller and more agile than Strabag SE. Polish operations likely have more autonomy for operational tools. Less bureaucratic procurement than larger multinationals. |

### Why They Fit

PORR Polska occupies an interesting middle ground: large enough to have real coordination challenges (1,500 employees, major infrastructure projects) but with a parent company that's more agile than Strabag or Skanska. PORR Group's recent expansion in Poland means the Polish operation is growing faster than corporate infrastructure can support, creating tool gaps that IC Project can fill.

The company's specialization in tunneling and complex infrastructure adds project complexity that demands structured coordination. Tunnel projects in particular have sequential dependencies, safety milestones, and multi-shift coordination needs that spreadsheets handle poorly.

### Recommended Approach

**Growth outpacing corporate tools.** "You're winning more Polish contracts than ever. Is your coordination infrastructure keeping up with your growth?"

- **Target persona:** Country Director for Poland or Head of Infrastructure division
- **Entry point:** Pilot on a new project win — position IC Project as the coordination tool for the next major contract
- **Value proposition:** Project coordination that scales with Polish growth, field team management across infrastructure sites, subcontractor scheduling
- **Pricing context:** 40-80 users at 39-79 PLN = 1,560-6,320 PLN/month

### Key Risk/Challenge

Austrian parent may push their own tools as Polish operations grow (the bigger you get, the more corporate pays attention to your tool stack). Window of opportunity is now, while Polish ops are growing but not yet fully under corporate IT governance. Also, PORR's expansion means they're busy winning contracts, not evaluating PM tools — outreach timing matters.

---

## 9. Skanska Polska

**HQ:** Warsaw, Poland (Polish operations)
**Size:** ~2,000 employees in Poland
**Revenue:** ~3B PLN (~700M EUR, Polish operations estimated)
**Sector Focus:** Building construction (commercial, residential) and civil engineering (roads, bridges). Polish arm of Swedish Skanska AB.

### ICP Score: 68/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 21 | 25 | 2,000 employees, 3B PLN revenue in Poland. Major player. Strong brand. Deduction: large multinational parent with mature IT. |
| Technographic | 11 | 20 | Skanska AB is one of the most digitally mature construction companies globally. They invest heavily in BIM, digital twins, and proprietary project tools. The gap between corporate tools and field use is likely smaller than at other multinationals. Hardest nut to crack technographically. |
| Buying Intent | 20 | 35 | Low corporate intent — Skanska sees itself as a digital leader. But specific project teams or departments running legacy processes still exist. Pockets of pain, not systemic pain. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Large organization with many potential entry points. Department heads, project managers, and regional directors could champion adoption. Nordic management culture is generally open to innovation. |
| Engagement Readiness | 8 | 10 | Swedish corporate culture values innovation and efficiency. If IC Project can demonstrate clear value, even a multinational like Skanska can move. Polish operations have reasonable autonomy for operational tools. |

### Why They Fit

Skanska Polska is the hardest target on this list from a technographic perspective — Skanska AB genuinely invests in digital construction tools. However, no corporate tool stack perfectly covers every team's needs. The opportunity at Skanska is hyper-targeted: find the specific departments or project types where corporate tools are overkill or poorly adopted, and where teams default to simpler coordination methods.

Residential development projects (where Skanska competes with ATAL, Dom Development, etc.) may be the entry point — these are more similar to developer workflows than heavy infrastructure, and corporate tools designed for mega-projects may be a poor fit.

### Recommended Approach

**Target departments where corporate tools are a poor fit.** Don't position against Skanska's digital strategy — position as a complement for specific project types.

- **Target persona:** Head of Residential Development or a Regional Project Director for building construction
- **Entry point:** Residential or smaller commercial projects where enterprise tools are overkill
- **Value proposition:** "Your infrastructure mega-projects deserve Primavera. Your residential projects deserve IC Project — purpose-built for multi-site development coordination."
- **Pricing context:** 20-40 users in a department at 39-79 PLN = 780-3,160 PLN/month — essentially a rounding error

### Key Risk/Challenge

Highest risk of "we already have tools for that" objection. Skanska's digital maturity means the pain threshold is higher — they need to see clear differentiation from what they already have. If the initial conversation hits corporate IT, it will be blocked. Must stay at the operational/departmental level. Also, Nordic decision-making culture (consensus-driven) means longer sales cycles even within Polish operations.

## 10. Kajima Poland

**HQ:** Warsaw, Poland (Polish operations)
**Size:** ~200-500 employees in Poland (estimated)
**Revenue:** ~500M-1B PLN (~115-230M EUR, estimated)
**Sector Focus:** Industrial and commercial construction. Polish subsidiary of Japanese Kajima Corporation (one of Japan's largest contractors, 150+ year history).

### ICP Score: 65/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 17 | 25 | Smaller Polish operation (200-500 employees). Revenue modest compared to other targets. Japanese parent adds cultural complexity. However, niche focus (industrial/commercial) creates concentrated PM needs. |
| Technographic | 14 | 20 | Japanese parent likely uses Japan-centric tools and processes. Polish operations may struggle with tools designed for Japanese workflows and language. High likelihood of ad-hoc local solutions filling the gap. |
| Buying Intent | 20 | 35 | Moderate — smaller operation means fewer simultaneous projects and less acute coordination pain. But the Japan-Poland gap in tools and processes creates friction that a local PM tool could resolve. |
| Persona Mapping | 7 | 10 | Small enough that the Country Director is accessible. Japanese management structure may mean key decisions require Tokyo approval, but operational tool choices may be delegated locally. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Japanese corporate culture values consensus and thorough evaluation — long sales cycle. However, Polish operations leadership may have significant autonomy for day-to-day operational decisions. Relationship-building is more important than cold outreach. |

### Why They Fit

Kajima Poland represents a specific niche: a subsidiary of a Japanese megacorp where the parent company's tools and processes don't translate well to Polish operations. Japanese construction project management is highly methodical (and effective), but the tools built for Japanese workflows may not serve a 200-500 person Polish operation running European-style projects with Polish subcontractors.

The opportunity is in the cultural-operational gap: Kajima Japan has world-class processes, but the Polish team needs tools that work in Polish, with Polish subcontractors, on Polish project timelines. IC Project, as a Polish-built platform, has an inherent advantage here.

### Recommended Approach

**Local tools for local operations.** "Kajima's global excellence in project delivery deserves local tools that match Polish construction workflows. IC Project is Poland's leading PM platform for construction — built for how Polish projects actually run."

- **Target persona:** Country Director or Operations Manager for Poland
- **Entry point:** Relationship-based approach — attend industry events, Japanese-Polish business chambers. Cold outreach is less effective with Japanese-affiliated companies.
- **Value proposition:** Polish-language, Polish-workflow PM tool that bridges the gap between Kajima global standards and local project execution
- **Pricing context:** 20-40 users at 39-79 PLN = 780-3,160 PLN/month

### Key Risk/Challenge

Smallest target on the list with the longest potential sales cycle (Japanese corporate culture). If Tokyo mandates a specific tool, there's no path forward. The relationship-building investment may not justify the deal size. Prioritize only if there's an existing connection to Kajima Poland leadership (e.g., through industry associations or events). Cold outbound ROI is likely negative for this account.

## Key Value Propositions
1. **Performance capacity:** Get more output without adding headcount — supplements support focus, energy, recovery

4. **Measurable impact:** Track utilization, energy trends, and team health metrics
5. **Retention & culture signal:** A benefit employees actually talk about and use daily

## Competitive Landscape
Mos Health is NOT directly competing with:
- **Mental health platforms:** Lyra, Spring Health, Modern Health, Headspace, BetterHelp
- **Fitness platforms:** Gympass/Wellhub
- **Primary care:** One Medical
- **General wellness:** Virgin Pulse, Limeade

Mos Health is **complementary** to these — "the foundation that makes other wellness programs work better." Position as standalone benefit OR complementary layer.

## What to Detect as Competitors in Benefits Stack
When researching a prospect's benefits, flag if these are already present: Lyra, Gympass, Spring Health, Modern Health, Headspace, BetterHelp, One Medical. These aren't competitors per se but show the company already invests in employee wellness — which is a positive buying signal.

## Patrycja's Approach
- **Discovery-first:** Never pitch on the first call. Validate problem/solution fit.
- **Mom Test principles:** Ask about past behavior and current reality, not hypotheticals or future intent.
- **Specificity over generic:** Every brief, question, and talking point must be specific to the person and company.

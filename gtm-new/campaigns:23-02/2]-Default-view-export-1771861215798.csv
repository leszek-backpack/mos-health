"Christopher Engman","Christopher","Engman","Engrate","Co-Founder","100004800","https://www.linkedin.com/company/100004800","A typical Njord client has complexities in the deal making such as…
Cross hierarchical decision making on the customer side (often higher up than most people realise)
Cross functional decision making
A complex offering that takes a long time for new people to handle on their own
The environment on the customer side is a blend of processes and interfacing technologies

These 4 complexities lead to another key trait of our clients, which is a very high dependency on key people in the deal making. Often a CEO, a CTO and a Head of sales. We call it the rainmaker dependency. Hiring more and more sales people only makes the matter worse as your rainmakers have to hold the new sales peoples’ hands, which they don't have time for. We often see companies making the mistake of recruiting too many new sales people and then ending up in the calendar problem. They find themselves having to support everyone else and then experiencing lower sales as a consequence.

Most of our clients aim at becoming the leader in their category and in their core customer segment. It is also quite common that a Njord client is trying to establish or grow a new solution category which has its own list of challenges and special moves.

Scaling rainmakers is a leverage problem.

When we built Njord, we started with the customer and worked backwards. How do the world’s leading companies actually run their most important, high-stakes deals. The answer was. They use 14 to 18 disconnected systems and several full-time specialists just to manage the motion. The tech stack alone costs about €19k per month. It works, but only for the biggest enterprises.

Most companies will never get access to that level of capability. 
And that felt fundamentally wrong.

So we built Njord to change this.
It gives every rainmaker the power of a Fortune 500 deal room at less than 10 percent of the cost.

Small teams win bigger deals.
Challengers compete with giants.
And rainmakers finally get the platform they always should have had.

"Martin Port","Martin","Port","Build Concierge","Founder Chairman and CEO","100401488","https://www.linkedin.com/company/100401488","Born in the UK and now living in Israel, I have always been driven by innovation and execution. My entrepreneurial journey began early, starting a printing business as a teenager, followed by a career defined by resilience, determination, and building category-defining companies, despite personal challenges including dyslexia and hearing loss.

After transitioning into technology in 1998, following a decade building speciality bakery businesses in New York and Leeds, I founded Masternaut at the age of 40. Masternaut pioneered web-based vehicle tracking in the UK and, under my leadership, grew to become Europe’s largest fleet management service. The business was sold for $80m in 2011 and is today owned by Michelin, the world-famous tyre and mobility business.

In 2013, I founded BigChange, a mobile workforce management platform that transformed how field service businesses operate. Over the following eight years, BigChange became a market-leading technology company and was awarded the Queen’s Award for Enterprise. In 2021, Boston-based Great Hill Partners invested $100m, valuing the company at $135m. In 2024, BigChange was acquired by Simpro Group, backed by K1, at an enterprise value exceeding $450m.

My current venture, Build Concierge, valued at $50m, is an omnichannel customer engagement platform built for the entire service industry. We have distilled decades of operational and technology experience into a new AI-enabled SaaS platform that automates time-consuming processes, connects fragmented systems, and raises customer service standards.
With Build Concierge, companies never miss a call or a message. Every customer interaction across voice, email, SMS, WhatsApp, webchat, and social media is captured, structured, and converted into actionable insight.

Our AI Concierge Advisors operate 24/7, delivering the right information at the right time across text, image, and video, augmenting existing teams rather than replacing them. The result is consistent, high-quality customer engagement at scale.

Alongside building businesses, I actively support the entrepreneurial ecosystem as an angel investor. My investments include Handshaik, Rated People, Panintelligence, Electron Green, and StoriBoard.

I am also a committed philanthropist, supporting local communities and charitable causes through my registered charity, the Amanda and Martin Port Foundation.

As the Co-Founder and CEO of multiple companies within The Loop co Group, including LoopOS, and Book in Loop, I am dedicated to transforming businesses toward sustainable, circular practices through innovative software tools and strategic leadership.

With expertise spanning financial management, stakeholder relations, and change management, I’ve successfully scaled companies, led mergers and acquisitions, and built international teams. My leadership at Loop Future and BiLD Analytics allowed me to guide two high-impact organizations through substantial growth, one of which was acquired by a British private equity firm, further validating our data science and engineering offerings. At Loop Future, I helped secure over €10M in private equity investments, fuelling expansion and international reach for the company’s IT services.

Each venture, from Book in Loop—a pioneering textbook resale platform now The Loop Group’s foundation—to LoopOS’s sustainable business solutions, reflects my commitment to a future of social impact, data excellence, and green innovation.

Co-founder and CEO of Sulapac, an internationally awarded material innovation company with the mission to save the world from plastic waste. Sulapac helps brands across industries to replace conventional plastics with a sustainable alternative that doesn’t compromise functionality or aesthetics. 

Together with our customers and partners Sulapac has a crucial role in accelerating the plastic waste-free future and the change towards a circular economy. Succeeding takes boldness, ambition and determination, and this is what team Sulapac is all about. However, to ultimately accomplish the mission, a set of solutions is needed: We must take an interdisciplinary approach and collaborate across industries and sectors, globally.


Before founding Sulapac with my colleague PhD Laura Tirkkonen-Rajasalo and Antti Pärssinen, I worked in leadership positions for 10 years at universities in Finland and The Netherlands. I’m specialized in medical biomaterials and have supervised 7 PhD theses, 14 Master’s theses and 5 Bachelor’s theses. Science is always close to my heart, and the backbone of Sulapac.","","Software Development","Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland","Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland","ACwAAAD7DiQBsXj6dt1irKM9WxPr7SSa13X7W-A","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAD7DiQBsXj6dt1irKM9WxPr7SSa13X7W-A/","false","https://linkedin.com/in/suvi-haimi-6046155","✅ Record Found","Qualified","High (LinkedIn Active)","Status Code: 202","✅ Record Found","[{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""Jun 2024""},""description"":"""",""name"":""Ovido"",""title"":""CEO and Co-Founder""},{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""Jun 2024""},""description"":"""",""name"":""Sulapac Ltd"",""title"":""Chairwoman""},{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""Sep 2023""},""description"":"""",""name"":""Kvanted"",""title"":""Venture Partner""},{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""Nov 2022""},""description"":"""",""name"":""Solidium Oy"",""title"":""Board Member""},{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""May 2021""},""description"":"""",""name"":""Kiilto"",""title"":""Board Member at Kiilto Family""},{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""Jun 2021""},""description"":"""",""name"":""Finnish Startup Community"",""title"":""Board Member""}]","✅ Record Found","```json

Together, these innovations transform Travel Retail into a seamless, data-driven ecosystem where every transaction builds trust, loyalty, and growth.

"Abel Navajas","Abel","Navajas","STAMP","CEO","11314148","https://www.linkedin.com/company/11314148","I’m the CEO of STAMP — the Real Tax Free solution that helps merchants boost in-store sales by offering international shoppers an instant deferral of VAT payment before checkout.
No queues. No paperwork. No delays. Just higher conversion at the point of sale.

Since 2009, I’ve been deep in the tax-free industry — first at Global Blue, then as founder of Woonivers. Both acted as intermediaries in the refund process.

With STAMP, we’re doing things differently: we build the technology that empowers merchants to serve global shoppers directly, using AI, data, and embedded finance to drive seamless, real-time results.

Since 2018, I’ve been fully focused on innovation and technology — not just as an entrepreneur, but also as a lecturer at leading institutions like ESADE (FT Top 10 Executive Education) and IED, Italy’s reference for fashion and innovation.

To make all this possible, I build teams from scratch — because innovation and disruption don’t come from code alone. They come from humans creating together with purpose.

But I'm convinced that for the modern fleet, electrification isn't just a green initiative; it's a strategic investment that delivers tangible returns.

When we started Rightcharge, the challenge was clear. The transition to EVs was being held back by fragmentation and complexity. Good people in fleet, finance, and HR were spending their days buried in spreadsheets or mopping up after existing fuel systems that weren’t built for EV, trying to make it work.

We believe choosing and managing sustainable transport should be effortless. That’s why we’re building the revenue engine behind sustainable business growth for our customers.

We exist to make the selling and adoption of clean transport easier. We do this by providing one unified platform that turns the chaos of charging payments into a simple, automated system.

With Rightcharge, you can: 
✅ Access over 70% of the UK’s public charging network.
✅ Pay drivers the precise cost for home charging, automatically and without admin. 
✅ Get a single, HMRC-compliant bill for all home, public, and workplace charging. 
✅ Prevent fraud with technology that links charging sessions to specific work vehicles. 
✅ Gain strategic insights on costs and carbon to track your ESG goals.

An EV bought today gets cleaner every year, just by plugging in. Our mission is to make that process as simple and scalable as possible.

Fleets using Rightcharge are now confidently reimbursing their employees, cutting costs by up to 90% and carbon by 30%, while eliminating the risk of fraud. The result is that businesses are transitioning their vehicles to EVs faster than ever before.

If you're leading a fleet through its transition to electric, I'd love to connect.","Simplifying electric vehicle charging for fleets and drivers | Top 100 Trusted Brands in Fleet

As Founder and CEO, I set the vision and strategy for Rightcharge, steering our mission to simplify and accelerate the transition to sustainable transport. My focus is on building a world-class team, fostering a culture of customer-obsessed innovation, and ensuring we solve the real-world challenges that fleet operators face when electrifying their vehicles.","Software Development","Greater London, England, United Kingdom","London, England, United Kingdom","ACwAAAZb96gBux5YSTI-FyXoWwztY4gmzZxJsK8","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAZb96gBux5YSTI-FyXoWwztY4gmzZxJsK8/","true","https://linkedin.com/in/charlie-cook-2088922b","✅ Record Found","Qualified","High (LinkedIn Active)","Status Code: 202","✅ Record Found","[{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""Aug 2020""},""description"":""Simplifying electric vehicle charging for fleets and drivers | Top 100 Trusted Brands in Fleet\n\nAs Founder and CEO, I set the vision and strategy for Rightcharge, steering our mission to simplify and accelerate the transition to sustainable transport.

Over the past two decades, I’ve been part of several defining waves in global technology and value creation:

• The mobile revolution, when software first became truly global and scaled across continents.
• The emergence of European venture capital as a global force—I entered the industry in 2010, when VC in Europe was still fragmented and unproven. Over the following decade, I helped build one of the first globally-scaling investment platforms, developing strategies, leading investments across Europe, China, India, Israel, and the US, and proving that Europe could originate category-defining technology companies.

Today, I’m focused on the next frontier: where AI meets the physical economy. I’m applying everything I’ve learned about platforms, capital, and technology adoption to reinvent industrial procurement and support the decarbonization of heavy industry.

My core belief: lasting impact is created when three forces align—technology that changes what’s possible, capital that scales it, and operators who execute with clarity and discipline.

I continue to invest selectively in founders and technologies that can reshape essential industries. The next era of wealth creation will be built on intelligent systems that transform the real economy.","Transforming industrial procurement from complexity to certainty","Internet Marketplace Platforms","Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland","Finland","ACwAAABZXLUBmZeQ27_BLzGAM55fwUkLhOnMsiM","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAABZXLUBmZeQ27_BLzGAM55fwUkLhOnMsiM/","false","https://linkedin.com/in/waltermasalin","✅ Record Found","Qualified","High (LinkedIn Active)","Status Code: 202","✅ Record Found","[{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""Jan 2022""},""description"":""Transforming industrial procurement from complexity to certainty"",""name"":""Cronvall"",""title"":""CEO & Founder""},{""date"":{""end"":""Dec 2021"",""start"":""Jan 2021""},""description"":"""",""name"":""ngp capital"",""title"":""Venture Partner""}]","✅ Record Found","```json

The AI-based customs assistants are trained by customs specialists using the Digicust platform to write customs declarations and assign tariff numbers. From unstructured, incorrect and missing data, the application creates a cycle of qualitative, machine-readable information to automate customs clearance. 

The startup is already processing 150,000 customs declarations per year and supports any company interested in customs automation, such as customs agents, freight forwarders, industrial and trading companies worldwide. Due to the large number of customs cases already processed, Digicust offers an out-of-the-box automation level of between 70 and 90%. In combination with Digicust no-code automation and your customs software, be it AEB, Dakosy, dbh or any other customs solution, you can quickly and easily implement fully automated customs declarations. 

Our mission is to digitize the customs industry in a globally scalable and sustainable way, striving for hyper-automation that significantly improves the current supply chain in terms of speed, efficiency and security.","Digicust - Scalable Digitalization and Trustworthy AI for Customs Clearance of Tomorrow (www.digicust.com)

Digicust provides a set of virtual customs robots integrated into an AI-based pre-customs software ""Digital Customs"". These robots learn from customs specialists and officers to perform customs clearance. 

The first virtual customs robot Dexter IDP automatically fills out customs declarations with unstructured and structured data, based on API's, artificial intelligence, intelligent document processing and its machine customs know-how. 

Digicust's mission is to scalably and sustainably digitalize the customs industry globally, aspiring to hyper-automation; tremendously improving the current supply chain in speed, efficiency, and safety.

The vision of this startup is to overcome deep learning stability issues, its black box behavior, including its inability to learn from few samples, and the requirement of large, qualitative data sets to achieve high confidence measures. With these deep-tech innovations, Digicust aims to gradually automate the whole customs clearance process from: 

- creating forgery-proof customs documents, besides the fill-out of customs forms (virtual robots Dexter & Chuck), 
- controlling/requesting missing/right documents (virtual robot Neo), 
- over customs code classification (virtual robot Taric), 
- up to 24/7 self-running customs clearance (virtual robots working together and being integrated in the AI-based pre-customs software Digital Customs). 

With the Digicust IT ecosystem, it is possible to introduce the Internet of Customs, providing cutting-edge use cases for technologies such as Next Generation AI, Digital Twins, Quantum Computing and 5G resulting in the next customs revolution, 24/7 machine customs clearance, and supply chains with enormous speed increase and improved fraud detection.

Dafür stehe ich mit meinem jungen Scaleup OMMM.
Aus der Praxis für die Praxis. Echter technologischer Fortschritt, entwickelt in Deutschland, um Industriestandorte in Deutschland zu sichern.

OMMM implementiert bei ihren Kunden eine KI-basierte Software für das Operations Management mit dem Fokus Lebensmittelindustrie, FMCG und Sortenfertigung. Unsere Softwaremodule um den Kern Produktionsplanung herum bauen auf über 25 Jahre Spitzenforschung von Prof. Dr. Horst Tempelmeier an der Uni Köln auf. Weniger als 15 Monate ROI sind Benchmark.

Meine Kernthemen sind der übergreifende Aufbau des Unternehmens, von Strategie bis Vertrieb und Marketing. Hierbei baue ich auf 25 Jahre globale Erfahrung in Wachstum und Transformation auf, gleichzeitig lerne ich jeden Tag so viel Neues im Bereich Software und Operations Management.","KÜNSTLICHE INTELLIGENZ FÜR IHR OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
Eine optimale Planung war schon immer essentiell für erfolgreiche industrielle Produktion. Und unmöglich. Denn industrielle Planung ist so vielen Restriktionen und Abhängigkeiten unterworfen, dass sie zu komplex ist, um von menschlicher Intelligenz allein gelöst zu werden.

OMMM setzt auf künstliche Intelligenz und schafft so das bisher Unmögliche: Wir geben Planern echte Kontrolle über industrielle Produktionsplanung.

DIE OMMM PLANUNGS­SUITE
OMMM bietet vier Planungsmodule, welche unabhängig voneinander oder gemeinsam eingesetzt werden können, um allen planerischen Herausforderungen zu begegnen.

NAHTLOSE IT-INTEGRATION
OMMM ist als Cloud- oder On-Premise-Lösung implementierbar. Unabhängig vom existierenden ERP-System fügt sich OMMM mühelos in ihre bestehende IT-Landschaft ein, ohne eine datenführende Rolle zu beanspruchen.

Für das gängige ERP-System von SAP ist OMMM beispielsweise zertifiziert und ermöglicht durch SAP R/3, sowie SAP 4/HANA-Readiness eine nahtlose Migration.

OMMM FÜR ALLE
Innovativ und digital in eine transparente Zukunft: Wir machen ihre Planungskomplexität greifbar und schaffen Mehrwert - sowohl für die strategische als auch die operative Dimension ihrer Supply Chain.

DER OMMM-ALGORITHMUS BASIERT AUF 25 JAHREN SPITZEN­FORSCHUNG UND 10.000 ENTWICKLER­TAGEN UND GIBT PLANERN VOLLE KONTROLLE ÜBER DEN PLANUNGS­PROZESS.

"Bastian Maiworm","Bastian","Maiworm","amber","Co-Founder & CRO","28552914","https://www.linkedin.com/company/28552914","🛫I co-founded amber - Europe's leading business AI - because I know how difficult it is to find internal information. This is our story:

➡️Bevor I founded amber, I had to develop various things for my work - building on existing expertise. 
In order not to always start from scratch in my old jobs, I needed to know what expertise was already available in the company. Unfortunately, there was no way to search through all the information centrally; I had to jump from data silo to data silo and search there.
This was so frustrating that sooner or later I always had to ask my colleagues for help.
The figures from various studies confirm that I was not the only one with this problem: employees spend around 30 minutes a day searching for information digitally - a number that has risen by 77% in recent years.

When the opportunity arose in 2020 for my co-founders and me to solve this problem with the help of AI, we seized the opportunity and founded amberSearch. Here's what's happened since then:

1️⃣ - 2020: 
	- Founding amber
	- Acquisition of first customers such as Ruhrkohle AG (RAG) and Siemens Energy https://ambersearch.de/referenzen/
	- Publication of first own LLM's: https://ambersearch.de/open-source/
2️⃣ - 2021: 
	- Standardisation of our solution into a product
	- Acquisition of further customers
3️⃣ - 2022: 
	- Standardisation of distribution
	- Development of various connectors to other systems
	- Growth of the team to 15 people
4️⃣ - 2023: 
	- Integration of generative AI in amberSearch in the form of amberAI so that employees can chat with their own expertise
	- Acquisition of DB Regio AG as a customer via the db mindbox, including continuation
5️⃣ - 2024:
	- developing first version of our AI-Agents
        - Increasing the number of customers to more than 100
6️⃣  - 2025:
	- Starting to heavily scale across hundrets of companies
        - Winning first international customers
7️⃣  - 2026:
	- loading...

📈A team of 50 people now works for amber and together we look after over 400 customers. 

⭐What makes amber unique?

With amber, we provide companies with a product that can be used as a standard solution and can be connected with out of the box connectors. Thanks to our own AI models, we are able to make internal expertise as quickly and easily accessible as employees know it from the internet.

What started as a mission to centralize data has evolved into something much bigger. We quickly realized that the next frontier isn't just organizing data for humans—it's preparing it for AI.

Powerful AI agents and automation workflows are being built every day, but they all share a common limitation: they have no memory. They execute tasks, but they don't learn from them.

That's why we're building Boost.space as the ""database for AI."" Our platform is the AI-Ready data layer that provides the critical long-term memory for your agents. This is the key to unlocking self-improving systems that get smarter with every action.

We're building the foundational data layer for the future of agentic AI.

If you're building in the automation and AI ecosystem, I'd love to connect and share insights.

Als jemand, der selbst über 10 Jahre in einem klassischen mittelständischen Maschinenbauunternehmen gearbeitet hat, weiß ich, wie frustrierend es sein kann, wenn ein winziges Teil fehlt und plötzlich alles zum Stillstand kommt. 

Zeit ist hier ja wortwörtlich Geld. 

Deshalb habe ich beschlossen, die Sache selbst in die Hand zu nehmen und diesen Teufelskreis zu durchbrechen. Und unzähligen Maschinenbauern dabei zu helfen, das riesige Potenzial des Ersatzteilgeschäfts im After-Sales endlich als gewinnbringenden Wettbewerbsvorteil zu nutzen!

Mit meinem Co-Founder Fabian Gemmecke haben wir PartsCloud gegründet. Unsere Softwarelösung PartsOS Planning ermöglicht es OEMs, ihre Ersatzteilplanung endlich vorausschauend zu steuern - mit KI und Machine Learning statt Bauchgefühl. Mit präzisen Prognosen und datengestützten Einblicken stellt PartsOS Planning sicher, dass Ersatzteile zur richtigen Zeit verfügbar sind. Fehlbestände werden reduziert, Überbestände minimiert, Kosten gesenkt und unzufriedene Kunden endlich der Vergangenheit an.

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗱𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻:
- Ersatzteile vor Ort, bevor sie gebraucht werden
- Vorausschauender Service statt ständiger Feuerwehreinsätze
- Besserer Kundenservice, der dich vom Wettbewerb abhebt

Es liegt an uns allen, den Maschinenbau, Deutschlands zweitgrößte Branche, mit smarten digitalen Lösungen fit für die Zukunft zu machen. Geht nicht, gibts nicht.

Former pro athlete turned operator, I’m the Founding Head of Sales & Business Development at hypt (systematic word-of-mouth for financial services). I work where strategy meets execution: pipeline architecture, sales process, RevOps, partnerships, and leadership.

What I’m known for
• Turning GTM strategy into a weekly operating rhythm (clear ICP, stages, owners, dashboards)
• Coaching sellers & managers while fixing systems (enablement, tooling, RevOps, compensation)
• Cross-functional orchestration with founders/boards (pricing, launches, key accounts, partnerships)

Highlights
• Built and led Sales/BD at hypt from early stage; opened enterprise motion with regulated customers in DACH 
• Partnerships & programs with banks/insurers; exec-level materials, forecasting, and procurement readiness 
• Prior roles in BD, partnerships, and analytics ops at Lightly and PwC; co-founded a two-sided platform while studying at HSG 

Operator profile
• Comfortable in ambiguity; bias to clarity, cadence, accountability
• Data-driven (pipeline health, conversion, cycle time, NRR) and people-first leadership
• Equally effective as Sales Leader or cross-functional operator supporting CEO/CCO

Focus keywords
Sales Leadership • Go-to-Market • Revenue Operations (RevOps) • Pipeline Architecture • Enterprise Sales • Partnerships • Sales Enablement • Forecasting • Commercial Strategy • Cross-functional Execution

Most teams grow fast domestically, then hit a wall abroad: no focus, no real validation, and everyone too stretched to fix it.

That’s why you don’t need another consultant; you need an operator who jumps in, diagnoses what’s blocking revenue, validates the motion in the field, and builds the engine that scales.

How I help
• Find the bottlenecks slowing international revenue
• Focus the team on the motion that converts
• Validate it with paying customers
• Close the first deals
• Build the GTM machine and hand it over

No big consultancy playbooks.
No “best practice” decks lost in SharePoint.
Just hands-on execution until the motion runs.

Work spans maritime tech, industrial SaaS, compliance automation, offshore environmental tech, and AI/IDP workflows. Different sectors, same pattern: focus, validate, scale.

If your international growth is stuck and you need someone actually to fix it, reach out.

Enterprise sales today isn’t about better pitching; instead it’s about orchestrating decision-making across functions, translating operational complexity into value, and building GTM engines that hold up under pressure.

Over the last years, I’ve led and scaled sales teams in data-driven, low-digital and high-stakes environments most recently across European grocery retail, manufacturing and supply chains.

What I do in practice:
- turn complex operational problems into clear, defensible business cases
- navigate political buying centers across Ops, IT, Finance & Commercial
- coach AEs to run high-impact, consultative enterprise conversations
- design GTM motions that work where theory breaks and reality starts
- build sales orgs that stay effective as complexity increases

My style:
Hands-on. Analytical. Calm under pressure. I don’t push deals. I help teams see the decision landscape clearly and act with confidence inside it.

Today, as VP Sales at Freshflow, I’m responsible for scaling the commercial motion across Europe in a category-defining AI environment.
Translating product value into repeatable, sustainable revenue across fresh food retail.

I’m especially interested in conversations around:
- scaling consultative sales in complex industries
- enterprise GTM design & execution
- coaching senior sellers and frontline leaders
- navigating growth when deals get political, slow and messy

Let’s connect if you’re:
🔹 Leading or scaling a B2B Sales or GTM organization
🔹 Selling into complex, multi-stakeholder environments
🔹 Operating in data-heavy, operationally critical industries

#SalesLeadership #EnterpriseSales #ConsultativeSelling #GTMStrategy #SalesCoaching","As VP Sales at Freshflow, I own and scale the entire commercial motion across Europe, with a strong focus on DACH, France and strategic enterprise customers in grocery retail.

My role combines hands-on enterprise selling with building a repeatable, scalable go-to-market engine in a high-growth AI SaaS environment.

Key responsibilities & impact:

- Full ownership of revenue growth: pipeline strategy, deal execution, forecasting, and target achievement
- Leading and scaling the sales organization (Enterprise AEs & BDRs), including hiring, coaching, and enablement
- Driving complex enterprise deals with long sales cycles and multiple stakeholders (retail, category management, IT)
- Building and continuously refining sales playbooks, qualification frameworks, and enterprise sales motions
- Owning GTM strategy, CRM & sales analytics, and board-level reporting
- Close collaboration with Product, CS, and Leadership to align roadmap, value messaging, and customer outcomes

I grew up in a village in the north of the Netherlands, where a close-knit community and strong values shaped who I am. With a background in mechanical engineering and business administration, I’ve always been driven by curiosity, how things work, how systems connect, and how people thrive when given trust and responsibility.

Living in Taiwan during my studies opened my eyes to nature, but also global inequalities, especially around basic needs. That experience sparked a deeper purpose: I wanted to spend my time building something meaningful. In 2021, I co-founded HULO with my co-founders Frank and Rudy as a spin-off company focused on one of the world’s most pressing challenges—reducing water loss and ensuring access to safe, reliable drinking water. Because yes, 30% of all drinking water is lost globally... 

At HULO, we’re revolutionizing how water networks are monitored, using data and AI to detect leaks and inefficiencies before they become critical. My vision is that one day, I’ll be able to tell my grandchildren how we helped improve lives around the world by making clean water truly abundant.

I’m a go-getter at heart—honest, ambitious, and people-focused. I believe in leading by trusting others, creating space for growth, and building strong teams that move fast with purpose. Above all, I’m a family man inspired by making a lasting, positive impact.

For 30+ years, I’ve introduced and grown innovative technology companies across EMEA - taking breakthrough solutions from early-stage entry to commercial scale, multimillion revenues, M&A, and IPO contribution.

My focus today:
- Technology that drives sustainability. Tech for good.
- AI that changes behaviour.
- AI that reduces risk.
- AI that delivers measurable ROI.
- AI that helps people getting the job done.

Because the real opportunity in AI is not automation alone - it’s behaviour change at scale.

Founder – Ailuna
======================
Habits with impact. Action drives belief.
Ailuna is a gamified behaviour-change platform focused on sustainability, fraud prevention, and cybersecurity.

We help organizations embed positive daily habits that protect employees, customers, and consumers — while improving measurable business outcomes.

Less awareness.
More action.
Trackable impact.

Custom programs turn ESG, cyber resilience, and fraud prevention into scalable, data-driven behaviour change.

Strategic Advisor – Talvi
======================
Talvi unlocks the value in existing L&D content.

Using AI, employees can ask questions and receive precise answers in the moment of need — transforming static content into an interactive knowledge layer.

Higher productivity. Better retention. Stronger ROI on existing investments.

Strategic Advisor – InsureVision
======================
InsureVision applies AI video analytics to reduce fleet risk and lower insurance costs.

The platform analyzes forward-facing dashcam footage and surfaces only safety-critical events — no new hardware and no in-cabin cameras required.

Clear commercial value. Immediate ROI.

Endurance Mindset
======================
I’ve completed 12 × Ironman races — including Norseman Xtreme Triathlon — as well as Marathon des Sables (250 km), Cape Wrath Ultra (400 km), and long-distance ski races such as Vasaloppet and Birkebeinerrennet.

Long horizon thinking.
Disciplined execution.
Resilience under pressure.

I live by the Ironman mantra: Anything is possible.

If you’re building, investing in, or partnering around AI that drives real-world impact — let’s connect.","InsureVision uses state of the art end-to-end models to unlock the context in forward-facing dashcam video.

"Scarlett Smits","Scarlett","Smits","OpusFlow","VP of Marketing","86695436","https://www.linkedin.com/company/86695436","I believe marketing is both science and storytelling. My career started 15+ years ago, learning from the likes of Neil Patel, Moz Academy and many skillfull colleagues along the way, working across corporations large and small, and later building my own businesses. Today, as VP of Marketing at OpusFlow, I’m on a mission to turn us into the #1 ERP for sustainable installation companies.

I know what it takes to build something from nothing. With my husband and business partner Lee, I co-founded My360Tours.com — spotting a gap in real estate software and creating one of the most recognized virtual tour platforms used by thousands worldwide. Alongside that, we grew My360 Web Solutions into a thriving agency with 30+ international clients and a strong team of 9+ in Spain.

As a leader, my principle is simple: bring out the best in people. If you’ve got talent, I’ll push you to master it. I reward hard work, expect focus, and protect my team fiercely. People call me fair but consistent. My strengths lie in project management, budget control, and creative content, but my true skill is building high-performing, empowered teams. (And squeezing suppliers for every penny I can get!) 

At OpusFlow, I’m tackling a challenge that drives me mad: too many sustainable installation companies still rely on spreadsheets. We’re showing them how smart ERP can transform a mediocre business into a profitable, growing one in months. And with every company we help, we’re pushing the world toward a more sustainable future.

Achievements I’m proud of:

* Scaling My360Tours to global recognition & search engine dominance

* Growing My360 Web Solutions into an international agency

* Creating a life in Spain where business, family, and sunshine go hand in hand

Outside of work, you’ll find me hiking, exploring Spanish villages, enjoying tapas, or learning to play golf (jury’s still out).

"Seb Lapinski","Seb","Lapinski","Dealstack","Co-Founder","87138863","https://www.linkedin.com/company/87138863","I am an investor-turned-entrepreneur having spent over a decade as an investment professional doing deals in private equity.

Currently, I am a Co-Founder and COO of Dealstack, a ""private equity tech"" platform designed to revolutionise deal administration for private equity professionals and lawyers.

I helped found Dealstack to address a problem I experienced first hand during my time in private equity: the inefficiencies caused by repetitive administrative tasks that slowed down deal-making and value creation across the organisation.

At Dealstack, we’re streamlining common private equity workflows so that investment professionals and legal teams can focus on what matters to drive returns, not get bogged down by deal admin.

After a decade of experience in the finance sector, driven by a passion for boosting profitability, I came to the realization that managing subscription costs can be challenging for companies, as these expenses are often considered necessities. Collaborating with my co-founders, we recognized that the challenge of effectively managing Microsoft 365 subscriptions and users is no different from the broader subscription management landscape due to a lack of insight, resulting in companies paying a significant premium—often as much as 20% more than necessary—for their Microsoft 365 licenses.

The bookkeeping talent pipeline collapsed years ago, and AI that just ""automates transactions"" doesn't solve the real problem: 40-60% of transactions need human judgment—context that lives in emails, Slack threads, and the accountant's head.

I'm building Jenesys to capture that context and teach AI how problems actually get resolved. We've built the learning loop: a comms hub that captures query resolution, a headless reviewer that learns from corrections, and client rules that compound over time. The result is dedicated-bookkeeper accuracy at fractional cost—memory that scales.

Before this, I spent a decade in enterprise SaaS taking B2B service lines from first revenue to £8m ARR across FinTech, Telco, and AI. Earlier, I architected digital transformation programmes for insurance, banking and government IT services at Spark New Zealand. I started as a founder in 1998, exited in 2006, and came back to building in 2018.

What drives me: AI infrastructure that makes small businesses fundable by giving them numbers they can trust.","Accounting practices can't hire enough bookkeepers, and the ones they have are stretched across 30-80 clients - too many to remember the context each business needs for accurate numbers.

"Unai Royo","Unai","Royo","Dealcar","Founding Team | Head of Sales","91048946","https://www.linkedin.com/company/91048946","Te cuento un secreto: nunca he hecho una entrevista de trabajo. No porque sea un genio, sino porque el sector del automóvil me encontró antes de que pudiera buscar otra cosa. Con 19 años ya estaba vendiendo coches, y desde entonces no he parado.

Estudié Administración y Finanzas, pero donde realmente he aprendido ha sido trabajando, equivocándome, liderando equipos y cerrando operaciones en el día a día. He vivido de todo: momentos buenos, malos y otros en los que tocaba simplemente aguantar. Más de 1.500 coches vendidos, mil conversaciones, mil historias… y sobre todo, muchas lecciones. Aprendí a liderar, a mover equipos, a adaptarme rápido y a tomar decisiones bajo presión. Nunca estudié ventas ni liderazgo, pero siempre me han salido de forma natural.

He pasado por todos los modelos posibles: el B2C de mostrador de toda la vida, el B2B con empresas y profesionales, y ahora estoy en el mundo SaaS, donde las reglas son otras, pero la esencia es la misma. Ese recorrido me ha dado una visión muy completa de cómo se vende, cómo se trabaja en equipo y cómo se construye algo desde cero.

Y lo que cambió todo fue conocer, casi por casualidad, a Dealcar cuando todavía era una idea. Tenía una vida estable, con mi rutina, un buen sueldo y todo en orden… pero decidí dar el salto. Dejé esa seguridad para apostar por un proyecto/sueño que conecta de lleno con mi historia y con lo que creo que el sector necesita. Pasé de un entorno tradicional a uno 100% digital, y eso me obligó a aprender, desaprender y volver a construir.

Vengo del barro. De escuchar al cliente en persona, de cerrar ventas a pulso, de pelear cada oportunidad. Y por más que avance la tecnología, siempre voy a estar cerca de esa realidad. Porque es lo que me ha formado y lo que me sigue dando perspectiva cada día.

Me gusta la gente que trabaja, que no se cree más que nadie y que sabe de dónde viene. Al final, eso es lo que intento ser cada día: alguien comprometido, con los pies en el suelo, y con ganas de seguir aprendiendo.","Me incorporé al proyecto como primer comercial en una fase muy temprana, cuando todavía estábamos validando el producto y entendiendo bien las necesidades del sector. Empezamos con un enfoque 100% en field sales: visitar concesionarios, escuchar, probar y ajustar el mensaje. Esa experiencia nos sirvió para construir desde cero un sistema comercial propio, basado en lo que realmente funciona sobre el terreno.

Con el tiempo hemos evolucionado hacia un modelo más digital, combinando estrategias de field sales con online sales. Hoy lidero un equipo de 4 personas con enfoque full cycle: desde prospección hasta cierre y activación, siempre con cercanía y compromiso con los concesionarios.

Mi día a día:

- Vender, vender, vender...

- Coordinar el equipo comercial y trabajar codo a codo con ellos

- Diseñar, probar y mejorar el playbook de ventas

- Acompañar a concesionarios en su digitalización, desde la demo hasta su crecimiento real

- Colaborar con producto para traducir lo que pasa en la calle en soluciones útiles

- Analizar datos, detectar oportunidades y seguir afinando el proceso

Seguimos aprendiendo cada día.

My journey into the world of e-mobility started with a degree in economics, where I focused on sustainability and how innovation shapes economies. I carried that focus into my early career at HERE Technologies, where I discovered a deep interest in solving the real-world challenges of sustainable mobility.

Since then, I’ve built up over seven years of experience in the mobility and tech space. Fom commercial roles in sales and partnerships to launching products and crafting go-to-market strategies that make complex technologies feel simple and useful. 

At Cariqa, we're building the first end-to-end billing and pricing platform for EV charging – designed to give charge point operators full control, streamline operations, and make pricing more transparent and consistent across all channels. In my role as CCO I get to combine all of that: working hands-on with charge point operators, scaling our platform across Europe, and challenging the outdated status quo in EV charging.

I believe that if we want EVs to be the default way of getting around, we need to make charging just as intuitive as driving :))…","Shaping an EV ecosystem that’s transparent, direct, and finally connected.","Technology, Information and Internet","Berlin, Berlin, Germany","London, England, United Kingdom","ACwAACA9kikBean3BgHg90saJUA7A13_gkZ27Eg","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAACA9kikBean3BgHg90saJUA7A13_gkZ27Eg/","false","https://linkedin.com/in/tamara-ciullo","✅ Record Found","Qualified","High (LinkedIn Active)","Status Code: 202","✅ Record Found","[{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""Apr 2023""},""description"":""Shaping an EV ecosystem that’s transparent, direct, and finally connected."",""name"":""Cariqa"",""title"":""Co-Founder and CCO""},{""date"":{""end"":""Sep 2023"",""start"":""Apr 2022""},""description"":"""",""name"":""GoCardless"",""title"":""Product Marketing Manager""},{""date"":{""end"":""Apr 2022"",""start"":""Sep 2021""},""description"":"""",""name"":""HERE Technologies"",""title"":""Product Marketing Manager - Urban Mobility Lead""},{""date"":{""end"":""Sep 2021"",""start"":""Feb 2020""},""description"":"""",""name"":""HERE Technologies"",""title"":""Senior Product Marketing Specialist - Urban Mobility Lead""}]","✅ Record Found","```json

I have a proven track record in building and leading high-impact healthtech businesses, securing multi-million-pound investments, navigating complex regulatory pathways, and delivering commercial growth in mission-driven environments.

Previously, I was Entrepreneur in Residence at Oxford Science Enterprises and CEO of Health Data Research UK (HDRUK), the UK’s national institute for health data science, where I led national strategy and cross-sector innovation to harness data for patient benefit.

Before that, I was a Director at 2020 Delivery (now The PSC), advising NHS trusts, universities, and central government on strategy, transformation, and delivery. I began my career as a Chartered Engineer at ICI, followed by roles at McKinsey & Company.

I hold an MBA from Harvard Business School and MA/MEng from the University of Cambridge.

In complex B2B sales, success is not a coincidence—it is the result of a clear methodology. To me, selling means communicating the business value of a solution so precisely that closing a deal becomes the logical consequence of structured decisions, rather than the product of gut feeling or hope.

I have spent over 25 years perfecting this standard of operational excellence in tech sales. As a graduate in Media Informatics and a former founder with a successful exit, I know the entire journey: from the first line of code and achieving market leadership to selling my own company to a global corporation. Today, I combine this entrepreneurial foundation with deep expertise in Data Management, Analytics, and AI to make companies precisely steerable.

Expertise in Data-Driven Strategic Steering

I know that AI in B2B sales is only as valuable as the data foundation it operates on. My focus, therefore, lies on the strategic architecture:

Data Management & Quality: I know how to structure data sources and ensure data quality, so that information is not just present but serves as a reliable basis for executive decisions.

AI & Analytics: I understand how to deploy AI models and analytics tools to identify patterns in complex markets, objectively validate forecasts, and make the business value of a pipeline mathematically resilient.

Dual Role as Strategist and Mentor

🚀 In Operational Leadership: I know the levers required to transform sales processes from a ""black box"" into a reliable steering instrument for management. My focus is on architecting go-to-market models that make growth predictable—based on data validation rather than mere assumptions.

💡 As a Sparring Partner for Tech & AI Startups: I guide founding teams in establishing their market and sales strategies on a solid foundation from day one. I know the pitfalls of scaling and understand how to structure deals and build forecasts that stand up to the scrutiny of investors and decision-makers.

My goal remains constant: turning vague opportunities into reliable results—through technological intelligence, clear structures, and a consistent alignment with measurable business value.","Erfolgreicher B2B-Vertrieb bedeutet für mich, komplexe Lösungen so verständlich und greifbar zu machen, dass ihr geschäftlicher Nutzen für Kunden sofort sichtbar wird.

My career has taken me on many adventures across Europe, Asia, and U.S.: I’ve built global teams, scaled operations, led go-to-market, and advised companies on community-led growth.

Today, I’m VP of Growth and Marketing at OpenHealth Technologies, where we’re fixing one of healthcare’s biggest challenges: making lab data usable. Although 70% of health decisions rely on it, most of it remains fragmented and untapped. Our platform fixes that by transforming reports from any source into structured, AI-ready data and historical insights. We’re trusted by leading health and longevity organizations worldwide, including Roche, Aware and SmartFit. 

This work is deeply personal! After years of navigating my own health journey and challenges, I shifted my energy toward helping build a future where healthcare is proactive and personalized. 

Prior to this, I was part of the founding team at Social+, the platform powering in-app social networks for brands like Noom, Airbnb, Harley-Davidson, and Grupo Boticário. I also led Southeast Asia expansion for Thailand’s first fintech unicorn’s e-wallet ($4B TPV, backed by Alipay), and set up sourcing operations in rural China for an e-commerce startup (acquired).","The AI platform to manage health data that every health organization needs. Leading organizations trust us to tap into the value of lab data — inside their own apps and websites or through our white-label platform. 

We’re on a mission to empower every health organization to unlock the power of data and help build a healthier world. I lead full-funnel growth across GTM, marketing, sales and partner enablement. 

With $4M in venture funding and hubs in Germany, the Netherlands, and Brazil, we serve clients globally. Healthtech, wellness, and supplementation companies embed our API to launch new products and get access to AI-ready data while saving significant development resources. Clinics, laboratories, insurers, pharma, and longevity providers use our platform to deliver personalized care, reduce operational burdens, and engage patients.","Technology, Information and Internet","Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands","Germany","ACwAABQP1cABvsVLBIgVHE6PzZ9HjFtIolWYXck","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAABQP1cABvsVLBIgVHE6PzZ9HjFtIolWYXck/","false","https://linkedin.com/in/ivanaistochka","✅ Record Found","Qualified","High (LinkedIn Active)","Status Code: 202","✅ Record Found","[{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""May 2025""},""description"":""The AI platform to manage health data that every health organization needs.

That’s where I learned to navigate complexity with confidence: recognizing patterns, anticipating shifts and shaping strategies that blend vision with execution.

I’m a business leader who thrives on movement - creating opportunities, seeing possibilities where others see limits, and turning ideas into measurable growth.
My work is grounded in a simple belief: organizations change only when the people who lead them evolve.

My perspective is shaped by three anchors: energy, clarity, and trust in human potential.
I love teams that dare, take ownership and collaborate to build what did not exist before.

I bring structure where direction is needed, creativity where space is missing and a constant focus on tangible impact.

I believe in a new “Human + Technology” paradigm, where human intelligence remains central and AI becomes a powerful amplifier of value.
I believe in global cross-pollination, responsible innovation and partnerships that generate not only results but culture.

Across everything I do, I carry one ambition: to create spaces where talent activates, ideas turn into action and people feel part of something that evolves.

That’s the contribution I bring.

That’s what moves me.","","Technology, Information and Internet","Milan, Lombardy, Italy","Milan, Lombardy, Italy","ACwAABKC34IBxS98OStBHDYVkHbEG9duO7RpOF8","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAABKC34IBxS98OStBHDYVkHbEG9duO7RpOF8/","false","https://linkedin.com/in/luana-terrile-19601288","✅ Record Found","Qualified","High (LinkedIn Active)","Status Code: 202","✅ Record Found","[{""date"":{""end"":""Present"",""start"":""Nov 2025""},""description"":"""",""name"":""Klaaryo"",""title"":""Partner & Head of Sales""},{""date"":{""end"":""Nov 2025"",""start"":""Jan 2022""},""description"":"""",""name"":""Indeed.com"",""title"":""Sales Director, Italy""}]","✅ Record Found","```json

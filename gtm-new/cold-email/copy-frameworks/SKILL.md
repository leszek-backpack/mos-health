# Cold Email Copy Frameworks

## When to Use
- Writing cold email campaigns for new personas or verticals
- Rebuilding underperforming sequences that get opens but no replies
- Training SDRs or copywriters on high-converting email structure
- A/B testing new angles against existing templates

## Framework

### The 3 Laws of Cold Email Copy

Every cold email that converts follows these rules:

1. **Relevance > Cleverness** — A boring email about the right problem beats a clever email about nothing. Show you understand their world in the first line.
2. **One Job Per Email** — Each email has exactly one goal. Step 1 earns the reply. Step 2 earns the meeting. Step 3 earns the referral. Never combine.
3. **Earn the Reply, Don't Demand It** — Ask a question that confirms their situation before selling. "Are you seeing this too?" beats "Let's hop on a call."

### The SPARK Framework

Every high-performing cold email follows this structure:

| Element | What It Does | Length |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **S** — Subject | Pattern interrupt. Lowercase, 3-5 words, no clickbait. Reference their world. | 3-5 words |
| **P** — Personalized Opening | Prove you did homework. Reference a signal: hiring, funding, tech change, content they published. | 1-2 lines |
| **A** — Agitate the Problem | Name the specific pain. Use their language, not yours. Make them feel understood. | 2-3 lines |
| **R** — Relevant Value | One concrete outcome you deliver. Use numbers from similar companies. Not features — results. | 2-3 lines |
| **K** — Kick-off CTA | Low-friction question. Not "book a call" — instead "would it help to see how [similar company] handled this?" | 1 line |

**Total email length:** 60-120 words. Never exceed 150.

### 6 Copy Archetypes (Use One Per Campaign)

#### Archetype 1: The Observation
Best for: Companies showing a visible signal (hiring, funding, product launch)

```
Structure:
- Line 1: What you noticed (the signal)
- Line 2-3: What that usually means (the implication)
- Line 4-5: What others in their position did (social proof)
- CTA: "Seeing the same thing on your end?"
```

**When it works:** The prospect feels seen, not sold. The signal proves relevance.
**When it fails:** The observation is generic ("I see you're growing!") or outdated.

#### Archetype 2: The Problem/Solution
Best for: Well-understood pain points with measurable impact

```
Structure:
- Line 1: Name the specific problem
- Line 2: Quantify the cost of that problem
- Line 3-4: How you solve it (one sentence, outcome-focused)
- Line 5: Proof point (metric from similar company)
- CTA: "Worth a quick look?"
```

**When it works:** The problem is real, specific, and the prospect is actively feeling it.
**When it fails:** The problem is assumed, not validated from research.

#### Archetype 3: The Referral Ceiling
Best for: Founder-led sales companies relying on word-of-mouth

```
Structure:
- Line 1: Acknowledge their current growth channel (referrals, inbound)
- Line 2: Name the limitation ("but you can't control when the next one comes")
- Line 3: Contrast with predictable alternative
- Line 4: Brief credential
- CTA: "Would it help to see the playbook?"
```

**When it works:** Targeting founders who know they need outbound but haven't started.
**When it fails:** The company already has a mature outbound motion.

#### Archetype 4: The Creative Ideas
Best for: Prospects where you can generate specific, actionable campaign ideas

```
Structure:
- Line 1: "Our AI analyzed {{companyName}} and came up with 3 campaign ideas"
- Lines 2-4: Three specific, tailored campaign concepts
- CTA: "Think any of these could work?"
```

**When it works:** The ideas are genuinely specific to their business, not generic.
**When it fails:** Ideas are obvious or could apply to any company.

#### Archetype 5: The Benchmark
Best for: Data-driven buyers (VPs, Directors) who respond to metrics

```
Structure:
- Line 1: Industry benchmark or data point
- Line 2: How their performance likely compares
- Line 3: What top performers do differently
- CTA: "Want to see how you stack up?"
```

**When it works:** You have real benchmark data to reference.
**When it fails:** The benchmark is made up or too generic to be credible.

#### Archetype 6: The Whole Offer
Best for: When you don't have a specific signal but have a strong value prop

```
Structure:
- Line 1: One-sentence credibility ("We help [type of company] do [outcome]")
- Line 2-3: Specific result with proof ("Last quarter we helped [company] achieve [metric]")
- Line 4: Relevance bridge ("{{companyName}} looks like a fit because [reason]")
- CTA: "Open to hearing more?"
```

**When it works:** Your offer is strong enough to stand alone.
**When it fails:** Every company in the world could receive this email.

### Subject Line Formulas

| Formula | Example | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `{{companyName}} + [topic]` | `acme + outbound` | Default. Works for everything. |
| `[mutual connection] recommended` | `sarah recommended I reach out` | When you have a real referral |
| `[role] question` | `quick vp sales question` | Targeting specific titles |
| `[trigger event]` | `re: your series B` | Signal-based campaigns |
| `[metric] idea` | `pipeline idea` | Metric-driven prospects |
| `[competitor] alternative` | `thinking beyond zoominfo` | Competitive displacement |

**Rules:**
- Always lowercase
- Never use brackets, exclamation marks, or emojis in subjects
- 3-5 words maximum
- No "Re:" or "Fwd:" tricks — they destroy trust
- Test subject lines in batches of 200+ sends before drawing conclusions

---

### The Follow-Up Stack (3-Touch Minimum)

| Step | Timing | Goal | Angle Shift |
|------|--------|------|------------|
| **Step 1** | Day 0 | Earn the reply | Lead with observation or problem |
| **Step 2** | Day 3-4 | Add new value | Share a relevant resource, benchmark, or insight |
| **Step 3** | Day 7-10 | Create urgency or pivot | New angle, social proof, or "did this land with the right person?" |
| **Step 4** (optional) | Day 14+ | Breakup or referral | "Should I close this out?" or "Who else should I talk to?" |

**Critical rule:** Each follow-up must add NEW information. Never just "bumping this to the top of your inbox." Every touch needs its own value.

### Copy QA Checklist

Before any email goes live, verify:

- [ ] **Subject line:** 3-5 words, lowercase, no clickbait
- [ ] **First line:** References something specific to the prospect (not their company size or industry — a real signal)
- [ ] **Length:** Under 120 words (150 absolute max)
- [ ] **Reading level:** Grade 5-7 (use Hemingway App)
- [ ] **CTA:** One question, low-friction, not "book a call"
- [ ] **Tone test:** Would you send this to a friend? If it sounds like marketing, rewrite.
- [ ] **The "so what" test:** After every sentence, ask "so what?" — if the prospect wouldn't care, cut it
- [ ] **Personalization variables:** All `{{variables}}` resolve correctly for every lead in the list
- [ ] **Mobile preview:** Does it look good on a phone screen? (No long paragraphs, no walls of text)
- [ ] **Spam check:** No spam trigger words (free, guarantee, act now, limited time)

### Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Target | What It Tells You |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Open rate** | 60-80% | Subject line + deliverability health |
| **Reply rate** | 5-15% | Copy relevance + offer strength |
| **Positive reply rate** | 2-8% | True message-market fit |
| **Bounce rate** | < 3% | List quality |
| **Unsubscribe rate** | < 0.5% | Targeting accuracy |

**Key insight:** If opens are high but replies are low, your subject is good but your copy isn't resonating. If opens are low, fix deliverability or subjects first — don't touch the body copy yet.

## Templates

### Quick-Start Email Template
```
Subject: {{companyName}} + [topic]

{{firstName}},

[1-2 line personalized observation based on signal]

[2-3 lines agitating the specific problem]

[1-2 lines showing the outcome you deliver — with a number]

[Low-friction CTA question]

Best,
{{senderName}}
```

### Follow-Up Template (Step 2)
```
Subject: Re: {{previous subject}}

{{firstName}},

[New insight, resource, or data point they haven't seen]

[1-2 lines connecting it to their situation]

[Question that advances the conversation]

{{senderName}}
```

## Tips
- Write 10 subject lines before picking one — your first idea is rarely your best
- The best personalization comes from the prospect's own content: their LinkedIn posts, podcast appearances, blog articles, and conference talks
- Test one variable at a time — if you change the subject AND the body, you won't know what moved the needle
- Copy that works for SMB rarely works for Enterprise — always segment by company size
- Read your email out loud. If you wouldn't say it in a real conversation, rewrite it.
- The "3:1 rule": every email should be 3 parts about the prospect, 1 part about you

# IC Project — Client Brief

## Company

- **Product:** IC Project by nGroup System
- **HQ:** Kielce, Poland
- **Website:** icproject.com
- **Category:** Cloud-based project management platform

## Product Overview

IC Project is an all-in-one project management platform built for Polish businesses. Unlike Western competitors that require bolt-on integrations for financial tracking or localized workflows, IC Project ships with everything in the box.

### Core Modules

- **Task Management** — Kanban boards, task dependencies, subtasks, assignments
- **Gantt Charts** — Visual timeline planning with critical path tracking
- **Resource Planning** — Team capacity, workload balancing, availability calendars
- **Time Tracking** — Built-in timesheets, billable hours, utilization reports
- **Financial Module** — Budget tracking, cost allocation, invoicing (this is the killer differentiator — competitors need separate tools like Harvest, Toggl, or custom spreadsheets)
- **Document Management** — Centralized file storage, version control, sharing
- **Reporting & Dashboards** — Real-time project health, custom KPI dashboards, exportable reports

## Pricing

| Tier | Price (PLN/user/month) | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| Basic | 39 PLN | Core PM features |
| Professional | 79 PLN | + Financial module, advanced reporting |
| Enterprise | 129 PLN | Full platform, custom integrations, priority support |

**Competitive pricing context:** At current PLN/USD rates, even Enterprise tier costs roughly $30-33/user/month — comparable to mid-tier pricing on Monday.com or Asana, but with significantly more functionality included (especially the financial module).

## Target Market

- **Geography:** Poland (primary), expanding to CEE
- **Company size:** SMEs, 50-500 employees
- **Priority verticals:** Construction/development, manufacturing, IT/software, professional services
- **Buyer profile:** Operations directors, project office leads, CFOs evaluating tool consolidation

## Key Differentiators vs Monday / Asana / ClickUp / MS Project

1. **EU Data Residency** — GDPR-native architecture. Servers in Poland/EU. No data transfer to US. This matters for regulated industries and public-sector adjacent contracts. Global competitors either can't guarantee this or charge Enterprise pricing for it.

2. **Integrated Financial Module** — Budgets, cost allocation, invoicing built into the platform. Monday/Asana/ClickUp treat financials as an afterthought (if at all). MS Project handles scheduling but not finances. IC Project eliminates the need for a separate budgeting tool.

3. **Polish-Language Support Team** — Native Polish speakers, local timezone (CET). No waiting for US business hours. No language barrier on support calls. This is a real pain point for Polish SMEs who tried global tools.

4. **Industry-Specific Templates** — Pre-built workflows for construction (phase-gate, site management), manufacturing (production scheduling, quality control), and IT (sprint planning, release management). These templates match how Polish businesses actually operate, not Silicon Valley assumptions.

5. **No Per-Feature Upselling** — All features included at each tier level. No "upgrade to unlock Gantt charts" or "pay extra for time tracking." Each tier is a complete package. This simplifies procurement and eliminates budget surprises.

## Case Studies

### ATAL S.A. — Construction / Residential Development

- **Company:** One of Poland's largest residential developers. Multi-city operations across 7+ locations (Krakow, Warsaw, Wroclaw, Lodz, Katowice, Tri-City, and others). Publicly traded on WSE.
- **Challenge:** Fragmented communication between construction sites. Each location used its own mix of spreadsheets, email threads, and ad-hoc tools. Project milestones tracked inconsistently. Leadership had no single source of truth across the portfolio.
- **Solution:** IC Project deployed across all sites. Centralized project timelines, milestone tracking, and cross-site resource coordination.
- **Outcome:** Single dashboard for portfolio-wide project health. Standardized reporting from site managers. Reduced coordination overhead between HQ and field teams.
- **Takeaway for outreach:** Construction companies with 3+ active sites are the sweet spot. The pain is real and quantifiable.

### Wawel S.A. — Manufacturing / FMCG

- **Company:** Historic Polish confectionery manufacturer. 200 tonnes/day production capacity. 100+ brands. Cross-department operations spanning production, logistics, marketing, and R&D.
- **Challenge:** Spreadsheet-based production tracking across departments. No real-time visibility into cross-functional workflows. Marketing couldn't see production timelines. R&D worked in isolation from logistics.
- **Solution:** IC Project unified cross-department workflow management. Real-time dashboards replaced weekly spreadsheet reports.
- **Outcome:** Production, logistics, marketing, and R&D on a single platform. Real-time dashboards replaced manual reporting. Cross-department handoffs became trackable.
- **Takeaway for outreach:** Manufacturers with 3+ departments coordinating workflows are ideal. The pain is departmental silos and manual reporting.

## Competitive Positioning Summary

IC Project wins against global tools when the buyer needs:

- **(a)** Polish language interface and native-speaking support team
- **(b)** Financial module (budgets, costs, invoicing) built into the PM tool
- **(c)** EU data compliance without paying Enterprise-tier pricing
- **(d)** Industry templates that match Polish business processes and workflows

IC Project loses when the buyer needs:

- Deep ecosystem integrations with US-centric tools (Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack)
- Brand recognition for board-level procurement (Fortune 500 contexts)
- Global multi-language deployment across 10+ countries

**Bottom line:** IC Project is the strongest play for Polish SMEs who need a serious PM platform with financial tracking, don't want to overpay for a US tool, and care about data sovereignty. The construction and manufacturing verticals are the highest-conviction segments.

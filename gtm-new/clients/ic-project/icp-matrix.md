## Operationalizing the Matrix

### Data Sources for Scoring

| Data Point | Primary Source | Secondary Source |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Employee count | LinkedIn Company Page | Bisnode, KRS |
| Revenue | KRS financial filings | Bisnode, press releases |
| Hiring activity | Pracuj.pl, LinkedIn Jobs | NoFluffJobs, company careers page |

| Engagement signals | LinkedIn activity, company blog | Conference speaker lists, CRM history |

### Scoring Cadence

- **New prospects:** Score on intake before adding to any sequence
- **Tier 2-3 prospects:** Re-score monthly for signal escalation (hiring, expansion, leadership change)
- **Tier 1 prospects:** Score is locked at outreach start — re-evaluate only if outreach stalls after 3 touches
- **Below threshold:** Re-score quarterly or on trigger event only

### Handoff Rules

- **Tier 1 (85+):** Assign to senior AE. Personalized multi-channel sequence. Research brief required before first touch.
- **Tier 2 (65-84):** Standard automated sequence with light personalization. Escalate to Tier 1 if 2+ new intent signals appear.
- **Tier 3 (45-64):** Content nurture only (newsletter, case study sends, event invites). No direct sales outreach.
- **Below threshold (<45):** No resources allocated. Remove from active pipeline.

## Persona 1: Construction — Director of Projects (Champion)

### 1. Identity Profile

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Title patterns** | Dyrektor ds. Projektow, Kierownik Projektow, Director of Project Management, Head of Construction Operations |
| **Seniority** | Senior Director / VP-1 level |
| **Reports to** | VP Operations or CEO |
| **Team size** | Manages 5-15 project managers, each overseeing individual construction sites |
| **Scope** | Coordinates multi-site construction schedules across cities — owns timeline, resource allocation, and cross-site coordination |

### 2. Day-in-the-Life Map

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| **7:00-7:30** | Reviews overnight messages from site managers — WhatsApp groups, emails, missed calls |
| **7:30-9:00** | Morning call rotation with site managers — status updates, issue escalation, weather-related schedule changes |
| **9:00-10:30** | Subcontractor coordination meetings — negotiating timelines, resolving conflicts between trades |
| **10:30-12:00** | Resource allocation — shuffling equipment and crews between sites based on morning updates |
| **12:00-13:00** | Lunch (often interrupted by urgent site calls) |
| **13:00-15:00** | Executive reporting — manually compiling updates from all sites into PowerPoint/Excel for leadership |
| **15:00-16:30** | Document review — permits, drawings, contracts requiring sign-off |
| **16:30-17:30** | Planning for next day/week — adjusting master schedule based on today's developments |

**Core frustration:** The entire day is spent gathering information that should be available in one place. By the time reports are compiled, the data is already stale.

### 3. Pain Hierarchy

| Priority | Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Fragmented communication across construction sites** — different sites use different tools (WhatsApp groups, email chains, Excel trackers), no single source of truth for project status | Decisions made on outdated information, delays discovered too late, constant phone tag |
| **P2** | **Manual status reporting** — spends 5+ hours/week compiling updates from site managers into executive reports | Time wasted on reporting instead of managing, reports are stale by the time they reach leadership |
| **P3** | **Resource allocation conflicts** — cannot see real-time availability of equipment/crews across sites | Double-booking of cranes and specialized crews, idle equipment at one site while another site waits |
| **P4** | **Document version chaos** — drawings, permits, contracts scattered across email and file shares | Construction errors from outdated drawings, permit delays, legal exposure from unsigned contracts |
| **P5** | **Delayed milestone visibility** — finds out about delays after they have cascaded | Cannot proactively reallocate resources, delays compound across dependent tasks |

### 4. Motivation Map

- **Career advancement:** Wants to be seen as the person who brought order to chaos — the one who modernized how the company manages projects
- **Professional pride:** Hates being the bottleneck. Wants to run a tight operation where information flows without manual intervention
- **Team respect:** Wants project managers to have the tools they need so they stop calling with questions that should be self-service
- **Work-life balance:** The 5+ hours/week on manual reporting is personal time lost — reducing it is deeply motivating
- **Industry recognition:** Construction in Poland is modernizing — wants to be part of that wave, not left behind

### 5. Buying Behavior Profile

- **Trigger events:** New multi-site project won, merger/acquisition bringing more sites, embarrassing delay reported to board, key project manager quits citing frustration with tools
- **Evaluation criteria:** Construction-specific features first (Gantt with dependencies, milestone tracking, site-based views). Must handle Polish construction workflows, not generic project management
- **Budget authority:** Can champion internally but needs CFO sign-off for anything over 50K PLN/year
- **Evaluation timeline:** Q1 (budget planning) or Q3 (before new project cycles)
- **Proof required:** Wants a pilot on 2-3 sites before company-wide rollout. Needs to see adoption by site managers who are not tech-savvy
- **Decision influencers:** IT Director (security/integration concerns), site managers (will they actually use it?), CFO (cost approval)
- **Deal killers:** No Gantt chart, no mobile app for site use, English-only interface, no Polish-language support

### 6. Language Profile

**Words they use daily:**
- "harmonogram" (schedule) — the central artifact of their work
- "kamienie milowe" (milestones) — how they track progress
- "etapy projektu" (project phases) — how they think about work breakdown
- "koordynacja miedzyobiektowa" (cross-site coordination) — their unique challenge vs. single-project managers
- "podwykonawcy" (subcontractors) — the people they spend half their day managing
- "opoznienia" (delays) — the thing they fear most

**What resonates in messaging:**
- "Jeden widok na wszystkie budowy" (One view across all construction sites)
- "Koniec z kompilowaniem raportow w Excelu" (No more compiling reports in Excel)
- "Widzisz opoznienia zanim eskaluja" (See delays before they escalate)

**What falls flat:**
- Generic "project management" language without construction context
- English buzzwords (agile, sprint, kanban) — this is construction, not software
- Feature lists without workflow context

### 7. Anti-Persona Signals

Do NOT target this person when:
- Company has fewer than 5 active construction projects (pain is manageable with Excel)
- Single-site operations — cross-site coordination is the core value proposition
- Already using Primavera P6 or Oracle Aconex and satisfied — switching cost is too high
- Company is primarily a subcontractor, not a general contractor or developer (different workflow)
- Director who is 2-3 years from retirement and resistant to any change

### 8. Competitive Landscape

| Alternative | Why they consider it | Why IC Project wins |
|---|---|---|
| **Excel + Email (status quo)** | "It works, it's free, everyone knows it" | Breaks at 5+ sites. No real-time visibility. Manual reporting eats 5+ hrs/week |
| **Microsoft Project** | Enterprise standard, Gantt capabilities | Expensive per-seat, no real-time collaboration, steep learning curve, poor mobile experience |
| **Monday.com** | Modern UI, good collaboration features | No construction-specific templates, English-only support, no Polish localization for field teams |
| **Asana / Trello** | Easy to start, freemium | Too simple for construction dependencies, no Gantt, no resource management, no Polish support |
| **Primavera P6** | Industry standard for large projects | Massively over-engineered and expensive for Polish SMEs, requires dedicated admin, poor UX |

## Persona 2: Construction — Project Manager / Site Manager (End User)

### 1. Identity Profile

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Title patterns** | Kierownik Budowy, Kierownik Projektu, Project Manager, Site Manager, Inżynier Kontraktu |
| **Seniority** | Mid-level manager (5-15 years experience) |
| **Reports to** | Director of Projects |
| **Team size** | Manages 10-50 people on-site (foremen, subcontractor crews, engineers) |
| **Scope** | Owns a single construction site or project — responsible for daily schedule, quality, safety, subcontractor coordination, and site documentation |

### 2. Day-in-the-Life Map

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| **6:30-7:00** | Arrives on site before crews, walks the site to check overnight progress and identify issues |
| **7:00-8:00** | Morning briefing with foremen and subcontractor leads — assigns daily tasks, reviews safety, flags material shortages |
| **8:00-10:00** | On-site supervision — resolving conflicts between trades, checking quality, handling deliveries |
| **10:00-10:30** | Calls/WhatsApp to Director of Projects — verbal status update, escalation of blockers |
| **10:30-12:00** | Document work — updating Excel schedule, logging progress photos, reviewing drawings |
| **12:00-13:00** | Lunch (often on-site, interrupted by subcontractor questions) |
| **13:00-15:00** | Subcontractor meetings, inspection coordination, permit/authority interactions |
| **15:00-16:30** | Paperwork — daily logs, material orders, change order documentation, progress reports for HQ |
| **16:30-17:00** | Plans tomorrow's work, sends end-of-day update to Director (often via WhatsApp or email) |

**Core frustration:** Spends 2-3 hours daily on paperwork and reporting that adds no value to the actual construction. The Director asks for updates that require manually compiling data from 5 different places.

### 3. Pain Hierarchy

| Priority | Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Too many tools, none connected** — uses WhatsApp for communication, Excel for schedule, email for documents, phone for escalation, paper for daily logs | Context switching wastes 1-2 hours/day, information gets lost between tools, no single place to check status |
| **P2** | **Reporting burden** — Director of Projects and HQ demand daily/weekly reports that require manual compilation | 2-3 hours/day spent on reporting instead of managing the site, data is stale by the time it reaches HQ |
| **P3** | **Subcontractor coordination chaos** — 5-15 subcontractors on site, each with their own schedule, no shared view of dependencies | Trade conflicts (electrician arrives before walls are ready), idle crews waiting for previous trade to finish |
| **P4** | **Drawing and document access** — latest drawings are somewhere in email, which revision is current is unclear | Construction errors from outdated drawings (costly rework), time wasted searching for the right version |
| **P5** | **No visibility into what other sites are doing** — works in isolation, doesn't know if resources could be shared or if other sites have solved similar problems | Duplicate problem-solving, missed opportunities for resource sharing, feels disconnected from the organization |

### 4. Motivation Map

- **Professional efficiency:** Wants to manage the site, not push paper. Every hour spent on reporting is an hour not spent preventing problems
- **Respect from crews:** Subcontractors and foremen respect a PM who is organized, decisive, and doesn't waste their time in meetings
- **Career progression:** Wants to become Director of Projects — demonstrating ability to manage sites efficiently is the path upward
- **Work-life balance:** Construction PMs work long hours; a tool that reduces reporting time means getting home earlier
- **Pride in the build:** Genuinely cares about delivering quality on time — frustrated when administrative chaos causes preventable delays

### 5. Buying Behavior Profile

- **Role in purchase:** End User / Influencer — doesn't make the buying decision but their adoption determines whether the tool succeeds
- **Trigger events:** New project kickoff (looking for better way to manage from day one), post-project retrospective identifying coordination failures, Director of Projects asking them to pilot a new tool
- **Evaluation criteria:** Must work on mobile (on-site, often no desk). Must be simple enough that subcontractor foremen can understand task assignments. Must reduce reporting time, not add another tool to the stack
- **Adoption risk:** If the PM doesn't adopt it on-site, the whole investment fails. They are gate-keepers of daily data input
- **Proof required:** Demo showing mobile site management, task updates from the field, automatic progress reports generated from daily input
- **Deal killers:** Desktop-only (useless on construction site), complex onboarding (no time for 3-day training), requires internet always (sites often have poor connectivity), adds reporting burden instead of reducing it

### 6. Language Profile

**Words they use daily:**
- "harmonogram robót" (work schedule) — the living document they manage daily
- "podwykonawcy" (subcontractors) — the 5-15 crews they coordinate
- "dziennik budowy" (construction diary/log) — legally required daily documentation
- "odbiory" (inspections/handovers) — formal quality checks they coordinate
- "front robót" (work front) — which areas are available for which trades
- "opóźnienie" (delay) — the word they dread most

**What resonates in messaging:**
- "Mniej papierkowej roboty, więcej czasu na budowie" (Less paperwork, more time on site)
- "Raporty generują się same z danych, które i tak wprowadzasz" (Reports generate themselves from data you already enter)
- "Działa na telefonie, nawet na budowie" (Works on phone, even on the construction site)

**What falls flat:**
- Enterprise software language (dashboards, KPIs, digital transformation)
- Anything that sounds like "more admin work"
- Features they'll never use (financial modules, portfolio views)

### 7. Anti-Persona Signals

Do NOT target this person when:
- Very small projects (single-family homes, renovations) — not enough complexity to justify a PM tool
- PM who is essentially a foreman managing one trade — no cross-trade coordination pain
- Company where PMs have zero influence on tool selection (pure top-down IT)
- PM who is 3 years from retirement and resistant to any digital tool change
- Site with excellent existing processes (rare, but some large contractors have mature internal systems)

### 8. Competitive Landscape

| Alternative | Why they consider it | Why IC Project wins |
|---|---|---|
| **WhatsApp + Excel (status quo)** | Free, everyone knows how to use it, works on phone | No structure, no traceability, no automatic reports. IC Project replaces the chaos with organized task management that still works on mobile |
| **PlanRadar / Fieldwire** | Construction-specific, mobile-first | Focused on punch lists and inspections, not full project coordination. IC Project covers scheduling, tasks, documents, AND reporting |
| **Microsoft Planner/Teams** | Already available if company has Office 365 | No construction templates, no Gantt dependencies, no site-based views. Not designed for field work |
| **Paper + phone calls** | "This is how we've always done it" | Works until you manage 3+ subcontractors on one site. Then things start falling through the cracks |

---

## Persona 3: Construction — Board Member / CEO (Final Approver)

### 1. Identity Profile

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Title patterns** | Prezes Zarządu, Członek Zarządu, CEO, Dyrektor Generalny, Właściciel |
| **Seniority** | C-level / Board level |
| **Reports to** | Board of Directors / Shareholders |
| **Team size** | Oversees entire organization (100-5,000+ employees depending on company size) |
| **Scope** | Strategic direction, major investment decisions, company-level P&L. Approves technology investments above 100-200K PLN/year |

### 2. Day-in-the-Life Map

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| **7:30-8:30** | Reviews overnight reports, financial summaries, market news |
| **8:30-10:00** | Executive committee meeting — Director of Projects + CFO + Commercial Director report on active projects and pipeline |
| **10:00-12:00** | External meetings — clients, investors, bankers, government/permit authorities |
| **12:00-13:00** | Business lunch (often with partners or clients) |
| **13:00-15:00** | Strategic work — new market entry analysis, M&A evaluation, tender strategy for major bids |
| **15:00-16:30** | Internal reviews — problem projects escalated by Director of Projects, HR issues, legal matters |
| **16:30-17:30** | Board preparation, investor communications, industry association work |

**Core frustration:** Makes decisions about multi-million PLN projects based on data that's 2-4 weeks old. Learns about project problems in board meetings instead of dashboards.

### 3. Pain Hierarchy

| Priority | Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Board-level blind spots** — gets aggregated reports that hide project-level problems until they become crises | Embarrassed in board meetings by surprises, loses credibility with investors, can't course-correct early |
| **P2** | **No portfolio-level view** — can see individual projects (if Director of Projects sends a report) but can't see the company's entire project portfolio health at a glance | Can't strategically allocate resources, misses the big picture, over-invests in troubled projects and under-invests in healthy ones |
| **P3** | **Digital transformation lagging behind competitors** — knows the company needs to modernize but doesn't know where to start | Competitors who digitize first win better contracts, attract better talent, and operate at lower cost |
| **P4** | **Talent retention** — experienced PMs and directors are leaving for companies with better tools and processes | Institutional knowledge walks out the door, recruitment costs rise, projects suffer during transitions |
| **P5** | **Margin pressure** — construction margins are thin (3-8%), any inefficiency directly hits the bottom line | Budget overruns on 2-3 projects can wipe out annual profit, needs operational efficiency as a competitive moat |

### 4. Motivation Map

- **Legacy and reputation:** Many Polish construction CEOs built their companies from scratch — they care about the company's reputation in the market
- **Competitive positioning:** Wants to win bigger, better contracts — operational excellence is how you get invited to the table
- **Investor/board confidence:** Demonstrating control over a portfolio of complex projects builds trust and unlocks better financing terms
- **Growth without chaos:** The company is growing, but growth is only valuable if the organization can handle it without losing control
- **Industry leadership:** Active in PZPB (Polski Związek Pracodawców Budownictwa) or similar — wants to be seen as a modern leader

### 5. Buying Behavior Profile

- **Role in purchase:** Final Approver — signs off on investments above a threshold (typically 100-200K PLN/year). Rarely initiates tool evaluation; usually brought in by Director of Projects + CFO after pilot
- **Trigger events:** Board meeting where project problems surfaced unexpectedly, lost a major tender due to poor track record on delivery, competitor publicizing digital transformation success, new board member pushing for modernization
- **Evaluation criteria:** Does NOT evaluate features. Asks three questions: (1) "What's the ROI?" (2) "Who else in our industry uses this?" (3) "What's the risk if it fails?" Needs a 60-second elevator pitch, not a product demo
- **Budget authority:** Full authority. Can approve quickly (1-2 weeks) if Director of Projects and CFO both recommend it with data
- **Proof required:** Case study from Polish construction (ATAL is ideal), ROI model showing payback within 6-12 months, endorsement from internal champion with pilot results
- **Deal killers:** No industry case study ("we're not a test case"), vendor perceived as too small to be reliable, solution requires business disruption during implementation, CFO doesn't support the financials

### 6. Language Profile

**Words they use daily:**
- "portfel projektów" (project portfolio) — the strategic view they need but don't have
- "rentowność" (profitability) — the ultimate measure of success
- "przetarg" (tender) — how they win new business
- "reputacja" (reputation) — their currency in the market
- "zarząd" (board) — who they answer to
- "strategia rozwoju" (growth strategy) — what drives all major decisions

**What resonates in messaging:**
- "ATAL zarządza 7 miastami w jednym narzędziu" (ATAL manages 7 cities in one tool) — peer proof from a major Polish developer
- "Real-time widok na cały portfel projektów" (Real-time view of entire project portfolio)
- "3-8% marży w budownictwie — każdy procent efektywności się liczy" (3-8% margins in construction — every efficiency percent counts)

**What falls flat:**
- Feature-level descriptions (Gantt, Kanban, task management)
- Technical jargon (API, integrations, cloud architecture)
- Anything positioning IC Project as "project management software" — they need it framed as "operational control platform"

### 7. Anti-Persona Signals

Do NOT target this person when:
- CEO of a micro construction company (<20 people) — makes all decisions on gut feel, no process layer
- Founder-CEO who is also the Director of Projects — they ARE the champion persona, treat them as Persona 1 instead
- CEO in the final years before retirement/exit — no appetite for multi-year tool investments
- Company currently being acquired — all decisions on hold
- CEO with no operational involvement — pure financial/holding company structure where ops decisions are fully delegated to a COO

### 8. Competitive Landscape

| Alternative | Why they consider it | Why IC Project wins |
|---|---|---|
| **"Let's invest in ERP instead"** | One system to rule them all | ERP is a 12-24 month, 500K-5M PLN bet. IC Project can deploy in weeks, prove value, and complement (not compete with) ERP for project coordination |
| **SAP / Oracle / Comarch ERP** | Enterprise-grade, board-approved vendors | ERP handles financials and procurement but not project coordination across sites. IC Project fills the gap ERP doesn't cover |
| **Status quo + more PMs** | "We just need to hire better people" | Hiring doesn't fix broken processes. New PMs inherit the same fragmented tools and eventually leave frustrated |
| **Microsoft Project + Power BI** | Microsoft brand trust, already in the ecosystem | Requires heavy customization, no construction-specific templates, high training cost, no mobile field access |
| **Custom internal system** | "Our IT team will build exactly what we need" | Custom systems become a permanent cost center. IC Project is maintained, updated, and supported without diverting IT resources |

---

## Persona 4: Construction — CFO / VP Finance (Economic Buyer)

### 1. Identity Profile

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Title patterns** | Dyrektor Finansowy, CFO, Wiceprezes ds. Finansow, Chief Financial Officer |
| **Seniority** | C-level |
| **Reports to** | CEO / Board of Directors |
| **Team size** | Finance team of 5-20, plus dotted-line oversight of project controllers |
| **Scope** | Oversees financial performance of all construction projects, approves tool purchases, manages cash flow across multi-year project timelines |

### 2. Day-in-the-Life Map

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| **7:30-8:30** | Reviews overnight financial reports — cash position, invoice status, payment schedules |
| **8:30-10:00** | Financial review meetings — project controllers presenting budget vs. actual by site |
| **10:00-11:30** | Bank/investor calls — managing credit lines, project financing, bond payments |
| **11:30-12:30** | Meetings with project directors about budget variances and cost overruns |
| **12:30-13:30** | Lunch (often a working lunch with other executives) |
| **13:30-15:00** | Board preparation — consolidating financial data into board-ready presentations |
| **15:00-16:30** | Forecasting and scenario planning — cash flow projections, project profitability models |
| **16:30-17:30** | Procurement/contract reviews — subcontractor agreements, insurance, large purchases |

**Core frustration:** Financial data arrives too late and too aggregated to act on. By the time a cost overrun shows up in monthly reports, the damage is done.

### 3. Pain Hierarchy

| Priority | Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Budget overruns discovered too late** — monthly financial reviews show cost overruns that started weeks ago | Cannot course-correct in time, margin erosion on projects, board surprises |
| **P2** | **No real-time cost visibility per project/site** — has to wait for accounting to consolidate data from multiple systems | Decisions based on 2-4 week old data, cannot prioritize cash allocation effectively |
| **P3** | **Manual budget vs. actual tracking** — Excel-based, error-prone, always behind | Finance team spends 40% of time on data consolidation instead of analysis |
| **P4** | **Subcontractor cost management** — invoices do not map cleanly to project phases, making cost attribution difficult | Cannot determine true profitability per project phase, disputes with subcontractors over scope |
| **P5** | **ROI justification for every SaaS expense** — board scrutinizes technology spend, needs hard numbers | Avoids approving tools unless ROI is crystal clear, slows down modernization |

### 4. Motivation Map

- **Financial control:** Wants to know exactly where every zloty is going — real-time, not monthly
- **Risk mitigation:** Fears the board meeting where a project is revealed to be 20% over budget
- **Efficiency:** Believes the finance team should analyze, not compile — automation of reporting is deeply appealing
- **Strategic influence:** Wants to move from "reporting the numbers" to "shaping the strategy" — needs better data to do this
- **Professional reputation:** A CFO who delivers projects on budget gets board confidence and career advancement

### 5. Buying Behavior Profile

- **Trigger events:** Major budget overrun on a flagship project, audit finding about financial controls, new board member demanding better reporting, company growth making Excel unmanageable
- **Evaluation criteria:** ROI-driven above all else. Needs to see cost savings or efficiency gains in PLN. Cares about TCO (total cost of ownership) — license fees, implementation, training, ongoing support
- **Budget authority:** Final approval on all SaaS purchases. Can approve unilaterally up to board-set thresholds (typically 100-200K PLN/year)
- **Evaluation timeline:** 2-3 months from initial engagement to decision. Faster if tied to a specific project crisis
- **Proof required:** Business case with projected ROI, reference calls with similar-sized construction companies, 3-month pilot with measurable KPIs
- **Decision influencers:** Director of Projects (champion — "will the team actually use it?"), IT (security, integration with ERP), external auditors (compliance)
- **Deal killers:** No clear ROI model, hidden costs, poor integration with existing ERP (Comarch, SAP), vendor too small to trust with critical data

### 6. Language Profile

**Words they use daily:**
- "rentownosc projektu" (project profitability) — the metric they live by
- "kontrola kosztow" (cost control) — their primary function
- "budzet vs wykonanie" (budget vs actual) — the report they review every week
- "zwrot z inwestycji" (ROI) — the lens through which they evaluate everything
- "przeplyw pieniezny" (cash flow) — the constraint that keeps them up at night
- "TCO" / "calkowity koszt posiadania" (total cost of ownership) — how they evaluate purchases

**What resonates in messaging:**
- "Widzisz przekroczenia budzetowe w czasie rzeczywistym, nie po miesiacu" (See budget overruns in real time, not after a month)
- "Redukcja czasu raportowania o 60%" (Reduce reporting time by 60%)
- "ROI w pierwszym kwartale wdrozenia" (ROI in the first quarter of implementation)

**What falls flat:**
- Feature-first pitches (they don't care about Gantt charts)
- "Transformation" language without numbers attached
- Comparisons to tools they don't know or care about

### 7. Anti-Persona Signals

Do NOT target this person when:
- CFO who delegates all technology decisions to IT Director — they will never engage
- Company with a dedicated ERP already handling project financials end-to-end (SAP Project System, Oracle)
- Very small company where the CEO handles finances personally (no dedicated CFO role)
- CFO focused exclusively on M&A and capital markets, not operational finance
- Company in financial distress — no budget for new tools, survival mode

### 8. Competitive Landscape

| Alternative | Why they consider it | Why IC Project wins |
|---|---|---|
| **Excel (status quo)** | "Free, flexible, our team knows it" | Error-prone at scale, no real-time updates, massive manual effort, no audit trail |
| **ERP financial modules (SAP, Comarch)** | Enterprise-grade, integrated with accounting | Extremely expensive to customize for project-level tracking, 6-12 month implementation, overkill for mid-market |
| **Standalone budgeting tools** | Purpose-built for financial planning | No connection to project execution — still requires manual data entry from project teams |
| **Custom Excel + Power BI** | Tailored to their exact needs | Fragile, dependent on one person who built it, breaks when requirements change |

---

## Persona 5: Manufacturing — VP Operations / Production Director (Champion)

### 1. Identity Profile

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Title patterns** | Dyrektor Operacyjny, VP Operations, Dyrektor Produkcji, Production Director, COO |
| **Seniority** | VP / Senior Director level |
| **Reports to** | CEO or Managing Director |
| **Team size** | Oversees 50-200+ people across production, logistics, quality, and maintenance departments |
| **Scope** | Cross-department operations ownership — responsible for output, quality, efficiency, and on-time delivery |

### 2. Day-in-the-Life Map

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| **6:00-7:00** | Arrives at plant, walks the production floor — visual inspection, brief chats with shift supervisors |
| **7:00-8:00** | Morning production review — yesterday's output numbers, quality incidents, overnight issues |
| **8:00-9:30** | Cross-department standup — production, logistics, quality, maintenance leads report status |
| **9:30-11:00** | Logistics coordination — raw material delivery schedules, finished goods shipping priorities |
| **11:00-12:00** | Problem-solving — investigating bottlenecks, quality issues, equipment breakdowns |
| **12:00-13:00** | Lunch (at the plant, often reviewing dashboards or taking calls) |
| **13:00-14:30** | Planning — production schedule for next week, new product launch coordination, maintenance windows |
| **14:30-16:00** | Reporting and analysis — compiling KPIs, preparing updates for CEO, reviewing efficiency metrics |
| **16:00-17:00** | Strategic work — process improvement projects, vendor evaluations, team development |

**Core frustration:** Spends 60% of the day gathering information from different systems and people. Should be leading improvement, instead is playing human middleware between departments.

### 3. Pain Hierarchy

| Priority | Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Cross-department silos** — production, logistics, and quality teams use separate systems, manual handoffs create bottlenecks and errors | Logistics doesn't know what production finished, quality can't flag issues upstream, maintenance schedules conflict with production |
| **P2** | **Manual status updates** — production managers send daily emails/WhatsApp updates instead of real-time dashboards | Information is always 4-8 hours stale, urgent issues get buried in chat threads |
| **P3** | **Tool fragmentation** — uses 3-4 different tools (ERP for orders, Excel for scheduling, email for communication, maybe Slack/Teams) | Context switching kills productivity, data lives in disconnected silos, nothing integrates |
| **P4** | **No visibility into task-level progress** — knows output numbers but not which specific tasks are blocked or why | Cannot identify bottlenecks until they cause missed shipments, reactive instead of proactive management |
| **P5** | **Change management friction** — every new product launch or production line change requires manual coordination across 4+ departments | New product introductions take 2-3x longer than they should, errors in handoffs cause quality issues |

### 4. Motivation Map

- **Operational excellence:** Deeply cares about running a smooth, efficient operation — inefficiency is personally painful
- **Team empowerment:** Wants department heads to self-coordinate instead of escalating everything to them
- **Measurable improvement:** Loves KPIs and dashboards — wants to see OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), throughput, and quality metrics improve quarter over quarter
- **Modern manufacturing:** Reads about Industry 4.0 and digital transformation — wants to move their plant forward
- **Recognition from CEO:** A VP Ops who improves efficiency by 10-15% becomes the most valuable executive in the company
- **Work-life balance:** The 6am starts are sustainable only if the evenings are free — reducing firefighting means going home on time

### 5. Buying Behavior Profile

- **Trigger events:** Major production miss (missed shipment to key customer), new product launch that went badly, merger bringing a second plant online, key supervisor quitting because of tool frustration
- **Evaluation criteria:** Practical above all else. Wants to see it working on the factory floor within 2 weeks. Needs mobile access (walks the floor all day). Must be simple enough for shift supervisors with limited tech skills
- **Budget authority:** Can champion and push procurement, but needs CEO sign-off for purchases over 30-50K PLN/year
- **Evaluation timeline:** Will pilot with one department (usually production) for 4-6 weeks before rolling out company-wide
- **Proof required:** Live demo in a manufacturing context (not generic project management), reference from a similar-sized Polish manufacturer, mobile app demonstration on the factory floor
- **Decision influencers:** Department heads (will they adopt it?), IT (integration with ERP), CEO (strategic alignment and budget)
- **Deal killers:** Complex setup requiring IT involvement for weeks, desktop-only (no mobile), interface too complex for supervisors, no Polish language

### 6. Language Profile

**Words they use daily:**
- "linia produkcyjna" (production line) — the physical unit of their work
- "harmonogram produkcji" (production schedule) — the document that drives everything
- "wydajnosc" (efficiency/yield) — the metric they optimize for
- "przestoje" (downtime) — the enemy
- "koordynacja miedzydzialowa" (cross-department coordination) — the daily struggle
- "jakosc" (quality) — non-negotiable, especially in food/pharma manufacturing
- "OEE" (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) — the gold-standard KPI

**What resonates in messaging:**
- "Produkcja, logistyka i jakosc w jednym narzedziu" (Production, logistics, and quality in one tool)
- "Koniec z WhatsApp na hali produkcyjnej" (No more WhatsApp on the production floor)
- "Widzisz co jest zablokowane zanim zatrzyma linie" (See what's blocked before it stops the line)

**What falls flat:**
- Software/IT jargon (agile, sprints, backlogs)
- Generic "collaboration platform" language — they need manufacturing context
- Features described without factory-floor use cases

### 7. Anti-Persona Signals

Do NOT target this person when:
- Fully automated factory with MES (Manufacturing Execution System) handling everything — IC Project would be redundant
- Company with fewer than 3 departments — cross-department coordination is the core value proposition
- Heavy SAP user with SAP PP (Production Planning) fully deployed — switching cost too high, unlikely to add another layer
- Operations person who is purely strategic (no involvement in daily operations) — they won't champion a tactical tool
- Plant running a single production line with a single product — too simple to need cross-department coordination

### 8. Competitive Landscape

| Alternative | Why they consider it | Why IC Project wins |
|---|---|---|
| **Excel + WhatsApp (status quo)** | "Everyone uses it, no training needed" | Breaks when coordinating across departments, no real-time visibility, impossible to track what's blocked |
| **ERP modules (SAP PP, IFS)** | Already have ERP, natural extension | ERP project modules are rigid, expensive to customize, not designed for daily task coordination, poor mobile UX |
| **Monday.com / Asana** | Modern, flexible, good UX | No manufacturing context, English-only support, templates designed for software teams not factory floors |
| **MES (Manufacturing Execution System)** | Purpose-built for production | Expensive (500K+ PLN), 6-12 month implementation, overkill for coordination needs, doesn't cover cross-department workflow |
| **Microsoft Teams + Planner** | Already have M365 license | Too generic, no production scheduling, no dependency management, no manufacturing reporting |

## Persona 6: Manufacturing — Production Line Supervisor / Shift Manager (End User)

### 1. Identity Profile

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Title patterns** | Kierownik Zmiany, Kierownik Linii Produkcyjnej, Shift Manager, Mistrz Produkcji, Brygadzista |
| **Seniority** | Front-line manager (3-15 years in manufacturing) |
| **Reports to** | Production Director / VP Operations |
| **Team size** | Manages 15-60 operators on a shift or production line |
| **Scope** | Owns daily production output on their line/shift — responsible for hitting targets, quality checks, machine uptime, safety, and handoff to next shift |

### 2. Day-in-the-Life Map

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| **5:30-6:00** | Arrives 30 min before shift, reviews overnight shift handover notes (paper logbook or WhatsApp) |
| **6:00-6:15** | Shift briefing — assigns stations, communicates today's production plan, flags quality or safety issues from previous shift |
| **6:15-10:00** | Floor supervision — walking the line, troubleshooting machine issues, coordinating with maintenance, checking output vs. target |
| **10:00-10:15** | Break — catches up on WhatsApp messages from VP Ops, logistics requests, quality alerts |
| **10:15-12:00** | Continued floor supervision — handling material shortages (calls warehouse), managing operator breaks/rotation, documenting quality deviations |
| **12:00-12:30** | Lunch (on-site, near the line) |
| **12:30-13:30** | Paperwork — filling in production logs, downtime reports, quality checklists, material consumption forms |
| **13:30-14:00** | Shift handover preparation — writing notes for next shift, flagging unresolved issues, reporting final numbers to Production Director |

**Core frustration:** Spends 1-2 hours per shift on paper/Excel reporting that nobody reads in real time. By the time the VP Ops sees the data, it's yesterday's news. Meanwhile, problems on the line need instant coordination with maintenance, quality, and logistics — but those departments are in a different building, on a different system.

### 3. Pain Hierarchy

| Priority | Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Cross-department requests disappear** — needs maintenance to fix a machine, sends a request via email/phone/WhatsApp, no way to track if it's been received or when it'll happen | Unplanned downtime waiting for maintenance, production targets missed, frustration with other departments |
| **P2** | **Shift handover is unreliable** — written notes on paper or WhatsApp that the next shift may or may not read | Problems repeat across shifts, the same machine issue gets reported 3 times, critical context lost in shift transitions |
| **P3** | **Reporting is manual and duplicated** — fills in paper forms, then re-enters data into Excel, then VP Ops asks for the same data in a different format | 1-2 hours/shift wasted on reporting, data inconsistencies between paper and Excel, nobody trusts the numbers |
| **P4** | **No visibility into what other lines/departments are doing** — knows their own line's status but has no idea if warehouse has materials ready or if quality has flagged an issue upstream | Surprises when materials don't arrive, quality holds that come without warning, no ability to plan ahead |
| **P5** | **Feels disconnected from company decisions** — management announces changes (new product, schedule change, equipment move) that affect daily work, but communication comes late or through the grapevine | Unprepared for changes, wastes time on production plans that get overridden, feels disrespected by top-down decisions without consultation |

### 4. Motivation Map

- **Hit the numbers:** Takes pride in meeting production targets — their competence is measured in output, quality rate, and uptime
- **Smooth operations:** Wants a shift that runs without chaos — no machine breakdowns waiting on maintenance, no material shortages, no surprise quality holds
- **Respect from the team:** Operators follow a supervisor who is organized, fair, and doesn't waste their time with unnecessary meetings or paperwork
- **Recognition from above:** Wants VP Ops to see them as reliable and capable — the person who always hits targets and identifies problems early
- **Stability:** Many shift managers have been in manufacturing for 10-20 years — they want tools that make their life easier, not another "system" to learn

### 5. Buying Behavior Profile

- **Role in purchase:** End User — does not make buying decisions but their adoption is critical. If they refuse to use the tool, it fails. They are the "factory floor test"
- **Trigger events:** Asked by VP Ops to pilot a new tool, frustration after a particularly bad shift caused by miscommunication, new Production Director bringing in new tools
- **Evaluation criteria:** Must work on mobile or tablet (no desk on the floor). Must be simple — they'll judge it in 5 minutes. Must replace existing paperwork, not add to it. Must show immediate value (first shift, not first month)
- **Adoption risk:** HIGH — this persona will either champion the tool to their peers or kill it with passive resistance. Must feel like it was designed for them, not for management to spy on them
- **Proof required:** Hands-on trial on the floor (not a conference room demo). Show: task updates from mobile, shift handover in-app, maintenance request tracking with status
- **Deal killers:** Desktop-only, slow loading on old phones, requires typing long text (they wear gloves), perceived as surveillance ("management tracking my every move"), training that takes more than 30 minutes

### 6. Language Profile

**Words they use daily:**
- "zmiana" (shift) — their unit of time
- "linia" (line) — their territory
- "przestój" (downtime) — the enemy
- "wydajność zmiany" (shift output) — what they're measured on
- "awaria" (breakdown) — what ruins their day
- "przekazanie zmiany" (shift handover) — the daily ritual that never works well
- "zgłoszenie" (request/ticket) — what they send to maintenance and quality

**What resonates in messaging:**
- "Zgłoszenie do utrzymania ruchu z telefonu — i wiesz, kiedy przyjdą" (Maintenance request from phone — and you know when they'll come)
- "Koniec z papierowym dziennikiem zmianowym" (No more paper shift log)
- "5 minut szkolenia, działa od pierwszej zmiany" (5 minutes of training, works from first shift)

**What falls flat:**
- Anything about "digital transformation" or "strategy" — they don't care
- Management dashboards and KPIs — feels like surveillance
- Long feature lists — they want 3 things that work, not 30 they'll never use

### 7. Anti-Persona Signals

Do NOT target this person when:
- Fully automated line with minimal human supervision (robotics/MES handles everything)
- Very small operation (5 people on a line) — can coordinate verbally
- Supervisor who is 2-3 years from retirement and openly resistant to any technology
- Company where supervisors have zero voice in tool decisions and management will force adoption regardless
- Facility with excellent existing digital systems (MES + CMMS already integrated)

### 8. Competitive Landscape

| Alternative | Why they consider it | Why IC Project wins |
|---|---|---|
| **Paper logbooks + WhatsApp (status quo)** | Free, no training needed, works without internet | No traceability, shift handover notes get lost, maintenance requests disappear. IC Project digitizes without complexity |
| **CMMS (maintenance system)** | Dedicated maintenance request tracking | Only covers maintenance, not cross-department coordination. IC Project covers tasks, handovers, AND maintenance requests |
| **MES (Manufacturing Execution System)** | Real-time production tracking, automated data collection | MES tracks machines, not people and tasks. IC Project handles the human coordination layer that MES misses |
| **Excel on a shared drive** | "We already have it" | Can't update from the floor, version conflicts, no mobile access. IC Project works on any phone |

---

## Persona 7: Manufacturing — Quality Manager / Continuous Improvement Manager (Influencer)

### 1. Identity Profile

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Title patterns** | Kierownik Jakości, Quality Manager, Kierownik ds. Ciągłego Doskonalenia, CI Manager, Pełnomocnik ds. Systemu Zarządzania Jakością |
| **Seniority** | Mid-senior manager (reports to VP Operations or directly to CEO in smaller companies) |
| **Reports to** | VP Operations, Production Director, or CEO |
| **Team size** | Quality team of 3-15 (inspectors, auditors, lab technicians) |
| **Scope** | Owns quality systems (ISO 9001, IFS Food, BRC, HACCP), manages audits, drives continuous improvement projects, coordinates corrective actions across departments |

### 2. Day-in-the-Life Map

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| **7:00-8:00** | Reviews overnight quality reports — lab results, deviation logs, customer complaints from previous day |
| **8:00-9:30** | Morning quality round — walks the production floor, checks critical control points, reviews in-process inspection results |
| **9:30-11:00** | Corrective action follow-ups — chasing departments on open NCRs (Non-Conformance Reports), verifying that fixes were implemented |
| **11:00-12:00** | Documentation work — updating quality procedures, preparing audit evidence, reviewing supplier quality reports |
| **12:00-13:00** | Lunch |
| **13:00-14:30** | Cross-department meetings — quality review with production, supplier quality review with procurement, or customer complaint resolution with sales |
| **14:30-16:00** | Continuous improvement projects — analyzing data for root causes, planning kaizen events, preparing improvement proposals for VP Ops |
| **16:00-17:00** | Reporting — compiling quality KPIs, preparing monthly quality review for management |

**Core frustration:** Quality is everyone's responsibility but nobody's priority. Corrective actions are assigned but not tracked — the same issues resurface every audit. Spends more time chasing people for updates than actually improving quality.

### 3. Pain Hierarchy

| Priority | Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Corrective actions not tracked** — NCRs are issued but follow-up is manual (email, Excel), actions get lost or delayed | Same non-conformances repeat, audit findings reoccur, customer complaints increase, risk of losing certifications |
| **P2** | **Cross-department coordination for quality projects** — CI initiatives require cooperation from production, maintenance, logistics, procurement — each on different systems | Projects stall waiting for other departments, no visibility into who's blocking, improvement ROI never fully realized |
| **P3** | **Audit preparation is a nightmare** — evidence is scattered across paper files, Excel spreadsheets, email, and shared drives | 2-4 weeks of full-time work before every major audit, panic mode, risk of audit findings due to missing documentation |
| **P4** | **No real-time quality data** — quality KPIs are compiled monthly from manual inputs | Cannot intervene on quality trends early, management sees quality problems 4-6 weeks after they started |
| **P5** | **Quality is seen as a cost center** — management invests in production but not in quality systems or tools | Underfunded, understaffed, has to beg for resources, quality team morale is low |

### 4. Motivation Map

- **Zero audit findings:** Professional reputation is built on clean audits — every non-conformance feels like a personal failure
- **Systemic improvement:** Believes in data-driven quality — wants to move from firefighting to prevention
- **Cross-functional influence:** Quality touches every department — wants tools that give them visibility and credibility across the organization
- **Professional development:** Many Quality Managers aspire to VP Operations or Plant Director — demonstrating CI results is the path
- **Certification pride:** Maintaining ISO/IFS/BRC certifications is a point of professional pride and company-critical responsibility

### 5. Buying Behavior Profile

- **Role in purchase:** Influencer — doesn't control budget but has significant voice in tool decisions that affect quality and compliance. VP Ops listens when Quality Manager says "we need this for audit compliance"
- **Trigger events:** Failed audit finding, customer complaint spike, upcoming re-certification audit (3-6 months out), new CEO/VP Ops demanding quality metrics, regulatory change requiring new documentation
- **Evaluation criteria:** Can it track corrective actions with deadlines and responsibility? Can it generate audit-ready reports? Does it work cross-departmentally (assign tasks to production, maintenance, procurement)? Is it simpler than building another Excel tracker?
- **Budget authority:** Limited — typically can approve small purchases (<20K PLN) but needs VP Ops for larger investments. However, framing IC Project as "audit compliance tool" opens budget conversations that "project management tool" does not
- **Proof required:** Demo showing corrective action workflow (NCR → root cause → action → verification → close), cross-department task assignment, and automated report generation
- **Deal killers:** No audit trail (every change must be logged for compliance), no document versioning (critical for quality procedures), system requires quality team to do all the data entry (should distribute tasks to responsible departments)

### 6. Language Profile

**Words they use daily:**
- "niezgodność" (non-conformance) — the daily currency of quality work
- "działanie korygujące" (corrective action) — what they spend most time chasing
- "audyt" (audit) — the event their year revolves around
- "CAPA" (Corrective and Preventive Action) — the framework for fixing problems permanently
- "reklamacja" (complaint/claim) — customer-facing quality failure
- "KPI jakościowe" (quality KPIs) — what they report monthly
- "ciągłe doskonalenie" (continuous improvement) — their professional philosophy

**What resonates in messaging:**
- "Śledzenie działań korygujących w jednym miejscu — koniec z Excelem" (Track corrective actions in one place — no more Excel)
- "Przygotowanie do audytu w dni, nie tygodnie" (Audit prep in days, not weeks)
- "Przypisz zadania do produkcji i utrzymania ruchu — i monitoruj realizację" (Assign tasks to production and maintenance — and monitor execution)

**What falls flat:**
- Generic "project management" positioning — they need to hear "quality management" or "compliance"
- Features that don't map to audit/certification requirements
- Tools without audit trail (change history) — regulatory non-starter

### 7. Anti-Persona Signals

Do NOT target this person when:
- Company has no quality certifications and no plans to get them — no compliance driver for tool adoption
- Quality Manager with no cross-department authority (purely inspection/lab role, no CI responsibility)
- Company already using a dedicated QMS (Quality Management System like ETQ, MasterControl, Qualio) — no need for IC Project in this space
- Very small company where Quality Manager is one person wearing multiple hats and has no time for new tools
- Industry where quality is fully automated (pharma with validated systems, semiconductor with MES-integrated quality)

### 8. Competitive Landscape

| Alternative | Why they consider it | Why IC Project wins |
|---|---|---|
| **Excel (status quo)** | Free, flexible, everyone knows it | No automation, no notifications, no accountability. NCRs get lost in tabs, corrective actions expire without follow-up |
| **Dedicated QMS (ETQ, MasterControl)** | Purpose-built for quality, regulatory compliance | Expensive (50-200K PLN/year), complex implementation, overkill for mid-market manufacturers. IC Project covers 80% of needs at 20% of cost |
| **ERP quality module (SAP QM)** | Already in the ERP ecosystem | Rigid, expensive to customize, poor user experience. Quality teams avoid it and build shadow systems in Excel |
| **SharePoint/Teams** | Already available, document management built-in | No workflow engine, no task tracking, no corrective action lifecycle management |

---

## Persona 8: Manufacturing — CEO / Managing Director (Economic Buyer)

### 1. Identity Profile

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Title patterns** | Prezes Zarzadu, CEO, Dyrektor Zarzadzajacy, Managing Director |
| **Seniority** | C-level / Owner |
| **Reports to** | Board of Directors / Shareholders |
| **Team size** | Executive team of 4-8 direct reports (VP Ops, CFO, VP Sales, VP HR, etc.) |
| **Scope** | Overall business performance, strategic direction, investment decisions, market positioning |

### 2. Day-in-the-Life Map

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| **7:00-8:00** | Reviews overnight emails, news, market updates — scans for anything requiring immediate attention |
| **8:00-9:00** | Executive briefing — VP Ops presents production status, CFO presents financial snapshot |
| **9:00-11:00** | Strategic meetings — new market opportunities, product development, partnership discussions |
| **11:00-12:00** | Customer or partner meetings — key account management, relationship building |
| **12:00-13:30** | Lunch meeting (often with industry peers, board members, or investors) |
| **13:30-15:00** | Board preparation / investor relations — quarterly results, strategic plans, capital allocation |
| **15:00-16:30** | Internal strategic work — reviewing proposals, approving budgets, organizational decisions |
| **16:30-17:30** | Industry events, trade association work, or catching up on deferred decisions |

**Core frustration:** Makes strategic decisions based on information that is weeks old and filtered through multiple layers. Cannot confidently answer "How is the business actually performing right now?"

### 3. Pain Hierarchy

| Priority | Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Lack of visibility into operational efficiency** — gets reports weekly or monthly but needs a real-time view of what is happening across the business | Strategic decisions based on stale data, cannot react to problems quickly, surprises in board meetings |
| **P2** | **Cannot quantify inefficiency** — knows things are slow but cannot pinpoint where time and money are lost | Cannot prioritize improvement investments, relies on gut feel instead of data |
| **P3** | **Scaling pain** — company is growing but processes do not scale (what worked at 100 employees breaks at 300) | Growth creates chaos instead of profit, new hires become less productive, margins erode as company grows |
| **P4** | **Competitive pressure** — Polish manufacturers face increasing competition from Eastern Europe and Asia, need to optimize or lose margins | Every percentage point of efficiency matters, cannot afford to be slower than competitors |
| **P5** | **Employee retention** — talented operations people leave because of frustrating tools and processes | Losing a VP Ops or Production Director costs 6-12 months of productivity, institutional knowledge walks out the door |

### 4. Motivation Map

- **Legacy building:** Many Polish manufacturing CEOs are founders or second-generation — they care deeply about building something that lasts
- **Competitive positioning:** Wants to be known as a modern, efficient manufacturer — not a company stuck in the past
- **Growth enablement:** The company's growth ambitions are limited by operational capacity — unlocking efficiency unlocks revenue
- **Board/investor confidence:** Demonstrating operational control and continuous improvement builds trust with investors and board
- **Digital transformation narrative:** "Transformacja cyfrowa" is a powerful narrative in Polish industry — CEOs want to lead it, not follow
- **Talent attraction:** Modern tools attract modern talent — a modernized operation is a recruiting advantage

### 5. Buying Behavior Profile

- **Trigger events:** Board pressure to improve margins, competitor publicizing their digital transformation, VP Ops making a strong internal case, industry conference where IC Project was presented, company growth hitting operational ceiling
- **Evaluation criteria:** Strategic thinker — cares about competitive advantage and growth enablement, not individual features. Needs a board-level ROI story: "We invest X PLN, we save Y PLN, and we gain Z% efficiency"
- **Budget authority:** Final decision-maker. Can approve quickly if VP Operations champions it strongly with data
- **Evaluation timeline:** Quick to decide (2-4 weeks) if the internal champion has done the groundwork. Slow (3-6 months) if brought to them cold without internal advocacy
- **Proof required:** Board-ready ROI model, case study from similar industry (Wawel is powerful here), VP Ops endorsement with pilot results
- **Decision influencers:** VP Operations (champion — "will this actually work?"), CFO (financial validation), board members (industry perspective)
- **Deal killers:** Cannot articulate clear ROI, vendor perceived as too small/risky for critical operations, no case study in their industry, solution requires large upfront investment before proving value

### 6. Language Profile

**Words they use daily:**
- "efektywnosc operacyjna" (operational efficiency) — the KPI they track at the highest level
- "przewaga konkurencyjna" (competitive advantage) — the strategic lens for every decision
- "skalowalnosc" (scalability) — the constraint on their growth ambitions
- "transformacja cyfrowa" (digital transformation) — the narrative they want to lead
- "marza" (margin) — the number that keeps the lights on
- "kultura organizacyjna" (organizational culture) — they know tools shape culture

**What resonates in messaging:**
- "Wawel zarzadza 100 markami w IC Project" (Wawel manages 100 brands in IC Project) — social proof from a respected Polish brand
- "Efektywnosc operacyjna widoczna w czasie rzeczywistym" (Operational efficiency visible in real time)
- "Narzedzie, ktore skaluje sie z Twoja firma" (A tool that scales with your company)

**What falls flat:**
- Tactical feature descriptions (they don't care about Gantt charts or Kanban boards)
- Comparisons to foreign tools they have never heard of
- Bottom-up "let's start with one team" messaging — they think top-down

### 7. Anti-Persona Signals

Do NOT target this person when:
- CEO of a very small company (fewer than 50 people) who manages everything personally — no delegation layer, no need for cross-team coordination tools
- Company in financial distress — survival mode, no budget for operational tools, focused on cost-cutting not investing
- CEO who is purely financial/M&A focused with no interest in operations — delegates everything operational to COO and never engages
- Family-owned company where the CEO is resistant to any external tools ("we have always done it this way")
- Company already deep into a large ERP implementation (SAP, Oracle) — no appetite for another platform during a multi-year rollout

### 8. Competitive Landscape

| Alternative | Why they consider it | Why IC Project wins |
|---|---|---|
| **"We need a full ERP" mindset** | ERP solves everything in one system | ERP implementations cost 500K-5M PLN, take 12-24 months, and often fail. IC Project deploys in weeks and solves the coordination gap that ERP does not address |
| **Hiring more people** | "We just need more hands" | Throwing bodies at a process problem makes it worse. New hires need to be coordinated too, compounding the existing chaos |
| **Custom-built internal solutions** | "Our IT team can build exactly what we need" | Internal tools become the IT team's full-time job, never get finished, and the builder eventually leaves. IC Project is maintained and improved continuously |
| **Status quo (Excel + meetings)** | "It is working well enough" | It is working well enough at current scale. Growth will break it, and by then you are 6 months behind on implementing a real solution |
| **Microsoft 365 ecosystem** | Already paying for it, Teams + Planner + Project | Requires extensive configuration, no manufacturing templates, poor adoption on factory floors, no Polish manufacturing workflows |

---

## Multi-Persona Account Strategy

### Construction: 4-Layer Deal Flow

**Layer 1 — Project Manager / Site Manager (End User → Influencer)**

The PM feels the pain at ground level — 2-3 hours/day on paperwork, WhatsApp chaos with subcontractors, drawings scattered in email. They won't initiate a purchase but their adoption makes or breaks the deal. If approached first (e.g. at a site visit or industry event), they become a bottom-up advocate who tells the Director of Projects: "I found a tool that would save me 2 hours a day." Mobile-first messaging: "Działa na telefonie, nawet na budowie."

**Layer 2 — Director of Projects (Champion)**

The primary outbound target. They compile PM reports into executive summaries, coordinate across sites, and juggle 5+ communication channels. Open with their language: "harmonogram," "koordynacja międzyobiektowa," "kamienie milowe." Show them how IC Project eliminates manual status reporting and gives real-time visibility across all construction sites. They become the internal champion who builds the business case.

**Layer 3 — CFO / VP Finance (Economic Buyer)**

Does not care about Gantt charts or milestone tracking. Cares about: "rentowność projektu," "kontrola kosztów," "zwrot z inwestycji." The Director of Projects brings them a business case with ROI in PLN: hours saved on reporting, delays caught earlier, reduced rework. Reference the ATAL case study. Offer a measurable 3-month pilot with defined success criteria. The CFO validates the financials and approves the budget.

**Layer 4 — Board Member / CEO (Final Approver)**

Only enters the picture for larger deals (100K+ PLN/year) or company-wide rollouts. Needs a 60-second elevator pitch, not a demo. Three questions: "What's the ROI?", "Who else uses it?", "What's the risk?" The Director + CFO present the case together; IC Project provides board-ready materials (ATAL case study, ROI model, implementation timeline). Approval is fast if layers 2+3 have done the work.

**Key insight:** Each layer needs a different value message:
- **PM:** "Less paperwork, more time on site" (personal productivity)
- **Director:** "Real-time visibility, no more manual reporting" (operational control)
- **CFO:** "ROI in PLN, payback in 6 months" (financial return)
- **CEO:** "ATAL uses it, competitive advantage, 6-month payback" (strategic + peer proof)

### Manufacturing: 4-Layer Deal Flow

**Layer 1 — Production Line Supervisor / Shift Manager (End User)**

The factory floor test. If the supervisor can use IC Project on their phone between machine checks — updating task status, logging shift handover, sending a maintenance request — the tool will spread. If it takes more than 5 minutes to learn, it's dead. They don't care about dashboards or strategy; they want fewer paper forms and faster maintenance response. Win them in a 4-week floor pilot and they become your grassroots champions who tell other supervisors "this actually works."

**Layer 2 — VP Operations / Production Director (Champion)**

The primary outbound target. They feel cross-department silos, tool fragmentation, and manual reporting every day. Open with: "koordynacja międzydziałowa," "przestoje," "wydajność." Show them IC Project as a coordination layer that sits above ERP — not replacing it, but connecting the human work that ERP misses. They become the internal champion who runs the pilot and builds the business case.

**Layer 3 — Quality Manager / CI Manager (Influencer)**

The compliance lever. Quality Managers spend weeks preparing for audits, chasing corrective actions across departments, and compiling reports from scattered sources. Position IC Project as a corrective action tracker and audit prep tool — not "project management." When Quality Manager says "we need this for ISO compliance," it opens budget conversations that "project management tool" never would. They amplify the VP Ops champion with a compliance-driven argument.

**Layer 4 — CEO / Managing Director (Economic Buyer)**

Only enters for company-wide rollouts. Needs the Wawel story ("200 tonnes/day, 100 brands, one platform"), efficiency gains as percentages, and competitive advantage framing. Three questions: "What's the ROI?", "Who else in manufacturing uses it?", "Will it scale as we grow?" VP Ops + Quality Manager present the pilot results together. Approval is fast when the floor has already adopted it.

**Key insight:** Each layer needs a different value message:
- **Supervisor:** "No more paper, maintenance comes faster" (personal productivity)
- **VP Ops:** "One dashboard for all departments, real-time" (operational control)
- **Quality Manager:** "Corrective actions tracked, audit prep in days not weeks" (compliance)
- **CEO:** "Wawel uses it, 18-35% efficiency gains, scales with growth" (strategic + peer proof)

### Cross-Vertical Pattern

In both verticals, the 4-layer pattern is identical:

1. **End users validate, champions sell, influencers amplify, economic buyers approve.** Four distinct roles, four distinct messages. Never skip a layer — a CEO who approves without floor-level proof will cancel at renewal.
2. **Outbound targets Layer 2 (Champion).** The Director of Projects / VP Operations is the primary email sequence target. They feel the pain daily and have the authority to run a pilot. Layers 1 and 3 are engaged during the pilot; Layer 4 only when the deal needs executive approval.
3. **Tactical before strategic.** Prove the tool works in daily workflows before making the business case. A pilot with measurable results is worth more than any slide deck.
4. **The compliance angle opens budgets.** In construction, reference building regulations and documentation requirements. In manufacturing, reference ISO/IFS/BRC audits. "Compliance tool" unlocks budget conversations that "project management tool" does not.
5. **Polish context is non-negotiable.** Polish-language interface, Polish case studies (ATAL, Wawel), Polish support. Competing on features against Monday.com or Asana is a losing game. Competing on "we understand Polish construction/manufacturing" is the winning position.
6. **Social proof by vertical.** Construction champions respond to ATAL. Manufacturing champions respond to Wawel. Never mix them — a construction Director of Projects does not care about confectionery production, and a manufacturing VP Ops does not care about residential development.

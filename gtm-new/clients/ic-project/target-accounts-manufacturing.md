## 1. Intermag Sp. z o.o.

**HQ:** Olkusz, Poland
**Size:** ~300 employees
**Revenue:** ~200-400M PLN (~45-90M EUR, estimated)
**Sector Focus:** Specialty fertilizer and plant nutrition manufacturer. Innovative, export-oriented, Polish-owned. Products include foliar fertilizers, biostimulants, and micronutrient solutions.

### ICP Score: 83/100 (Tier 2, borderline Tier 1)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 20 | 25 | 300 employees — ideal mid-market. Polish-owned, no multinational parent. Single-site manufacturing with growing export operations. Revenue modest but growing. |
| Technographic | 18 | 20 | High probability of fragmented tools. Companies this size typically have an ERP for finance/inventory but use spreadsheets and email for project coordination (R&D projects, new product launches, export market entry, production scheduling). No enterprise PM tool. |
| Buying Intent | 31 | 35 | Innovation-driven company (R&D pipeline, new product launches, regulatory compliance projects, export market expansion). Each of these is a project that needs coordination. Growth trajectory means more complexity ahead. Likely feeling the pain but may not know PM tools are the solution. |
| Persona Mapping | 7 | 10 | Polish mid-market company — CEO/COO likely involved in operational decisions. Operations Director, R&D Director, and Production Manager are clear champion candidates. Short decision chain. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Polish-owned means no corporate parent approval needed. Mid-market company in Olkusz (Lesser Poland) — less vendor fatigue than Warsaw-based companies. Likely open to Polish-built solutions. May need education on PM tool category. |

### Why They Fit

Intermag is the highest-priority target on this list because it combines ideal firmographic fit with maximum approachability. At 300 employees, it's large enough to have real coordination challenges but small enough that the CEO or COO can make a tool adoption decision in weeks, not months. There's no multinational parent to block the deal, no enterprise IT department to navigate, and no existing PM tool to displace.

The company runs multiple types of "projects" simultaneously: R&D development of new fertilizer formulations (12-24 month cycles with regulatory milestones), new product launches (marketing, production scaling, packaging, distribution setup), export market entry projects (certifications, distributor onboarding, localization), and production optimization initiatives. None of these are "production" in the MES sense — they're all cross-functional projects that need coordination across R&D, production, quality, marketing, and sales.

### Recommended Approach

**Educate and demonstrate.** Intermag may not be actively searching for a PM tool — they need to be shown what structured project coordination looks like versus their current spreadsheet/email approach.

- **Target persona:** COO or Operations Director (whoever coordinates across R&D, production, and commercial functions)
- **Entry point:** Map their new product launch process — show how IC Project turns a chaotic multi-department process into a structured, visible workflow
- **Value proposition:** "You're running R&D projects, export expansions, and production improvements simultaneously across 6 departments. IC Project gives you one dashboard for all of it."
- **Pricing context:** 30-50 users at 39-79 PLN = 1,170-3,950 PLN/month — easily justified if one product launch ships even one week earlier

### Key Risk/Challenge

Olkusz is a smaller city — in-person demos require travel but are likely expected (mid-market Polish companies value face-to-face relationships). The "education" cost is higher than for companies already shopping for PM tools, but the conversion rate for educated mid-market companies is very high because there's no competing vendor in the deal. Main risk: company may see itself as "too small" for PM tools — messaging must normalize the category for this size.

## 2. Cedrob S.A.

**HQ:** Ciechanow, Poland
**Size:** ~8,000 employees
**Revenue:** ~7B PLN (~1.6B EUR)
**Sector Focus:** Poland's largest poultry producer. Fully vertically integrated: animal feed production, farming/breeding, slaughter, meat processing, further processing (ready meals, deli), packaging, distribution. Brands include Cedrob, Duda.

### ICP Score: 82/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 23 | 25 | 8,000 employees, 7B PLN revenue. Massive Polish-owned company. Vertical integration across 6+ operational divisions. Scale is excellent; slight risk of being "too big" but Polish ownership keeps it approachable. |
| Technographic | 15 | 20 | Vertically integrated companies this large in Poland typically have ERP (SAP or Comarch) for core operations but project coordination across divisions is ad-hoc. Feed production division uses different tools than meat processing division. Cross-division projects (new product lines, capacity expansions, regulatory compliance) fall through the cracks. |
| Buying Intent | 29 | 35 | Vertical integration creates constant cross-division projects: a new chicken product requires R&D, farming adjustments, processing line setup, packaging design, distribution logistics. Each of these crosses 3-4 divisions. Coordination pain is structural and ongoing. Additionally, food industry regulatory changes (EU, Polish) create compliance projects spanning all facilities. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Polish-owned — founder/family-led management with clear decision authority. COO or VP Operations spans divisions. Division heads (feed, farming, processing, distribution) are operational champions. Large enough for dedicated project management office (PMO) if it doesn't exist yet. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Polish-owned, no multinational approval needed. Family/founder-led companies can move fast on decisions when convinced. Ciechanow HQ is ~80km from Warsaw — accessible. However, 8,000-employee company has its own bureaucracy. |

### Why They Fit

Cedrob is the most compelling manufacturing target because its vertical integration creates a unique and painful coordination challenge that few companies face at this scale. When Cedrob decides to launch a new product line — say, a new range of marinated chicken — the project touches every single division:

- Feed production adjusts formulations
- Farming/breeding adjusts flock plans
- Slaughter schedules new processing windows
- Meat processing sets up new lines or modifies existing ones
- Further processing develops recipes and production runs
- Packaging designs and orders new materials
- Distribution plans logistics for new SKUs

Coordinating this across 6+ divisions, multiple physical facilities across Poland, and thousands of employees is exactly the problem IC Project solves. The alternative (spreadsheets, email chains, monthly meetings) is how product launches slip by months and capital projects go over budget.

### Recommended Approach

**Vertical integration complexity angle.** "You control every step from feed to shelf — that's your competitive advantage. But coordinating a new product launch across 6 divisions and 10 facilities is your operational Achilles' heel. IC Project gives you one view from farm to fork."

- **Target persona:** COO or VP of Operations (the person responsible for cross-division coordination)
- **Entry point:** Map a recent new product launch or facility expansion project — show the coordination gaps that existed and how IC Project would have addressed them
- **Value proposition:** Cross-division project coordination, regulatory compliance tracking across all facilities, capital investment project management (new lines, facility expansions)
- **Pricing context:** 100-200 users (cross-divisional project managers, division heads, key coordinators) at 59-99 PLN = 5,900-19,800 PLN/month — negligible for a 7B PLN company

### Key Risk/Challenge

At 8,000 employees, Cedrob has internal complexity that could slow adoption. The IT department may push for enterprise solutions (SAP PM, Oracle). The rollout must start with one cross-division use case (e.g., new product launch workflow) and prove ROI before expanding. Also, food industry companies prioritize food safety and traceability tools over PM tools — IC Project must be positioned as solving a different problem (project coordination, not production tracking).

## 3. Fakro Sp. z o.o.

**HQ:** Nowy Sacz, Poland
**Size:** ~3,000 employees globally, ~1,500 in Poland
**Revenue:** ~2-3B PLN (~465-700M EUR, estimated)
**Sector Focus:** Roof windows, loft ladders, and accessories. Second-largest roof window manufacturer in the world (after Velux). Exports to 60+ countries. Polish-owned (founder Ryszard Florek).

### ICP Score: 81/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 22 | 25 | 1,500 Polish employees, 3,000 globally. Polish-owned, founder-led. Strong revenue and global reach. Manufacturing + export operations create complex coordination needs. Nowy Sacz HQ shows authentic Polish roots. |
| Technographic | 16 | 20 | As a global manufacturer, Fakro likely has ERP for production (SAP or similar). However, project coordination for R&D (new window designs), international market expansion, production line optimization, and quality improvement initiatives probably relies on fragmented tools. Polish-owned companies of this size often under-invest in PM tools relative to their operational complexity. |
| Buying Intent | 28 | 35 | Innovation-driven company competing against Velux (10x larger). Constant product development cycles. International expansion projects. Production optimization to maintain cost competitiveness. EU regulatory compliance (energy efficiency standards). All create project coordination needs. Fakro's competitive position demands operational excellence. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Founder-led company — Ryszard Florek is known for hands-on management and innovation focus. COO/VP Operations, R&D Director, and International Sales Director are clear targets. Founder involvement can accelerate decisions when convinced. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Polish-owned, founder-led — can move fast. Innovation culture suggests openness to new tools. However, Nowy Sacz is far from Warsaw — all engagement must account for geography. Founder's involvement means the champion must have his ear. |

### Why They Fit

Fakro is a uniquely compelling target: a Polish-owned global manufacturer competing against a Danish giant (Velux) that has 10x the resources. Fakro's survival and growth depends on being more agile and innovative — exactly the companies that benefit most from structured project coordination.

The company runs multiple types of projects simultaneously: R&D for new window designs and technologies (Fakro holds hundreds of patents), international market development projects (present in 60+ countries, each needing local certifications, distributor management, and marketing), production optimization (competing on cost with Velux requires constant improvement), and quality/compliance projects (EU energy efficiency standards evolve continuously).

As a Polish company selling globally, the coordination between Nowy Sacz headquarters (production, R&D) and international subsidiaries (sales, certification, marketing) is a persistent challenge. IC Project's cloud-based, multi-language capable platform fits this need.

### Recommended Approach

**Innovation and competitiveness angle.** "You compete with Velux on innovation speed. IC Project helps your R&D, production, and international teams coordinate product launches faster — from patent to shelf across 60 countries."

- **Target persona:** COO or VP of Operations (production coordination) or VP of International Sales (market expansion coordination)
- **Entry point:** Map the process from new product design through production setup to international market launch. Show the coordination gaps across R&D, production, quality, and international sales.
- **Value proposition:** Cross-functional product launch coordination, international market expansion project management, R&D pipeline visibility, production optimization tracking
- **Pricing context:** 50-100 users at 59-99 PLN = 2,950-9,900 PLN/month — easily justified by accelerating one product launch

### Key Risk/Challenge

Nowy Sacz is in southern Poland, far from major business centers. All engagement requires deliberate effort — video calls for initial contact, with in-person visits for demos and closing. Founder-led companies can be fast (the founder decides) or slow (the founder micromanages) — understanding Ryszard Florek's delegation style is important. Also, Fakro's competition with Velux may mean they're cautious about cloud tools from a data security perspective — address this early.

## 4. Mlekovita

**HQ:** Wysokie Mazowieckie, Poland (Podlasie region)
**Size:** ~5,000 employees
**Revenue:** ~6B PLN (~1.4B EUR)
**Sector Focus:** Poland's largest dairy company. Milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, cream, and specialty dairy products. Multiple processing plants across eastern and central Poland. Major export presence.

### ICP Score: 80/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 22 | 25 | 5,000 employees, 6B PLN revenue. Poland's #1 dairy company. Cooperative/private ownership. Multiple plants across Poland. Massive scale with complex multi-plant operations. |
| Technographic | 15 | 20 | Large dairy companies use ERP (likely SAP) and MES for production. But cross-plant coordination for projects (new product lines, plant expansions, quality certifications, marketing campaigns) is almost certainly fragmented. Different plants may use different local tools. |
| Buying Intent | 28 | 35 | Dairy industry is undergoing major change: consolidation, export market growth, product innovation (plant-based alternatives, premium lines), EU regulatory changes, sustainability requirements. Each of these generates cross-plant, cross-department projects. Multi-plant companies of this size have structural coordination pain. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Polish ownership — management accessible. COO/VP Operations manages multi-plant coordination. Plant directors and project managers are operational champions. Quality/compliance team runs cross-plant regulatory projects. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Polish-owned — fast decisions possible. Wysokie Mazowieckie HQ is remote (northeast Poland) — may have less exposure to SaaS vendors, meaning less vendor fatigue but also less category awareness. In-person presence matters for trust-building. |

### Why They Fit

Mlekovita's multi-plant operations across Poland create a structural coordination challenge. When the company launches a new product (e.g., a new line of Greek yogurt), the project spans multiple facilities: R&D develops the formulation, quality validates it, one or more plants set up production lines, supply chain adjusts milk sourcing and distribution, marketing plans the launch, and sales prepares retail partners. Each plant may be hundreds of kilometers from another.

Beyond product launches, Mlekovita runs constant cross-plant projects: quality certifications (IFS, BRC, ISO), plant modernization and expansion, sustainability initiatives, and export market development. These are not production tasks (handled by MES) — they're projects that need coordination across functions and locations.

### Recommended Approach

**Multi-plant coordination angle.** "You run 10+ plants across Poland. When you launch a new product or upgrade a certification, who coordinates across all of them? IC Project gives your operations team one view across every plant and every project."

- **Target persona:** COO or Head of Operations (the person who coordinates across plants)
- **Entry point:** Map their most recent cross-plant project (product launch, certification renewal, plant expansion). Show the coordination gaps.
- **Value proposition:** Cross-plant project visibility, new product launch coordination from R&D to retail shelf, regulatory compliance project management across all facilities
- **Pricing context:** 80-150 users (plant project managers, HQ coordinators, quality team) at 59-99 PLN = 4,720-14,850 PLN/month

### Key Risk/Challenge

Wysokie Mazowieckie is in remote northeast Poland — all engagement requires deliberate travel or strong video call rapport first. Dairy industry is operationally conservative. Mlekovita's cooperative roots may mean consensus-based decision-making. Also, if they recently invested in a SAP upgrade that includes project management modules, the tool gap may be smaller than expected. Qualify the tech stack early.

---

## 5. Grupa Gobarto (formerly PKM Duda)

**HQ:** Warsaw, Poland (operations across Poland)
**Size:** ~4,000 employees
**Revenue:** ~4B PLN (~930M EUR)
**Sector Focus:** Major Polish meat processor. Pork production, processing, and distribution. Multiple plants across Poland. Brands include Duda, Krakus, Cedrob (partially overlapping ownership).

### ICP Score: 79/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 21 | 25 | 4,000 employees, 4B PLN revenue. Multiple processing plants. Polish-owned, publicly listed. Strong market position in pork processing. |
| Technographic | 15 | 20 | Multi-plant meat processor — ERP and MES for production are likely, but cross-plant project coordination (new product development, plant expansions, regulatory compliance) is probably fragmented. Meat processing companies are typically behind dairy/brewing in digital maturity. |
| Buying Intent | 28 | 35 | Meat industry facing major headwinds: African Swine Fever disruptions, EU regulatory tightening (animal welfare, sustainability), price volatility, and pressure to diversify product lines. Each challenge generates cross-plant projects. Industry pressure creates urgency for better operational coordination. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Warsaw HQ with clear management structure. COO, VP Operations, and Quality Director are primary targets. Multi-plant structure means each plant has a director who could be a local champion. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Polish-owned, publicly listed. Warsaw HQ is accessible. Meat processing industry is less digitally mature than dairy or brewing — category education may be needed. However, industry pressures may create urgency for operational improvements. |

### Why They Fit

Gobarto's multi-plant meat processing operations face a unique set of cross-plant coordination challenges. Meat processing is subject to some of the tightest regulatory scrutiny in food manufacturing: HACCP, IFS, BRC, EU animal welfare regulations, and environmental compliance. Each regulation change triggers projects across every plant — audit preparation, process modifications, documentation updates, staff training.

Beyond compliance, Gobarto runs capital investment projects (plant expansions, line upgrades), new product development projects (new SKUs require R&D, production trials, packaging, marketing), and operational improvement projects (yield optimization, energy efficiency). These span multiple plants and departments and are too complex for spreadsheets but don't need full-blown enterprise PM suites.

### Recommended Approach

**Regulatory compliance coordination angle.** "Every EU regulation change triggers a project at every plant. IC Project gives you one platform to track compliance projects, plant expansions, and new product launches across all your facilities."

- **Target persona:** VP Operations or Quality/Compliance Director
- **Entry point:** Map their most recent multi-plant compliance project (IFS recertification, new EU regulation implementation). Show how IC Project would have simplified coordination.
- **Value proposition:** Multi-plant compliance project coordination, capital project management (plant expansions), new product launch workflow across plants
- **Pricing context:** 60-100 users at 59-99 PLN = 3,540-9,900 PLN/month

### Key Risk/Challenge

Meat processing industry is conservative and relationship-driven. Cold outreach effectiveness is lower — industry events and trade associations (Polskie Mieso, UPEMI) are better entry points. Also, Gobarto has undergone ownership/restructuring changes (former PKM Duda) — organizational priorities may be internal-focused. Verify that the company is in a stable enough phase to evaluate new tools.

## 6. Mlekpol (Spoldzielnia Mleczarska Mlekpol)

**HQ:** Grajewo, Poland (Podlasie region)
**Size:** ~4,000 employees
**Revenue:** ~5B PLN (~1.16B EUR)
**Sector Focus:** Major Polish dairy cooperative. Laciate brand (Poland's most recognized UHT milk). Milk, cheese, butter, cream. Multiple processing plants across northeast Poland.

### ICP Score: 78/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 21 | 25 | 4,000 employees, 5B PLN revenue. Major dairy player. Cooperative structure (owned by dairy farmers) — unique governance. Multiple plants. Strong brand (Laciate). |
| Technographic | 15 | 20 | Similar to Mlekovita — ERP for operations, likely fragmented project coordination across plants. Cooperative structure may mean even more decentralized tool adoption (each plant has more autonomy). |
| Buying Intent | 27 | 35 | Same industry dynamics as Mlekovita: product innovation, export expansion, regulatory compliance, sustainability. Cooperative structure adds complexity — coordinating projects across semi-autonomous plants within the cooperative framework. Moderate urgency. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Cooperative has a Management Board and Supervisory Board (farmer representatives). CEO/COO make operational decisions. Plant directors have significant autonomy. Need to convince both central management and plant-level champions. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Cooperative decision-making can be slower (board approval for significant investments). However, operational tools may fall within management discretion. Grajewo is even more remote than Wysokie Mazowieckie — relationship-building is essential. |

### Why They Fit

Mlekpol's cooperative structure creates a coordination challenge that corporate hierarchies don't face: semi-autonomous plants that need to coordinate without the top-down mandate that a corporate structure provides. When Mlekpol launches a new product under the Laciate brand, the cooperative must coordinate across multiple processing plants, each of which has its own operational culture, its own legacy tools, and its own plant director who answers to both the cooperative management and the local farmer-members.

This decentralized coordination problem is exactly what IC Project solves — providing visibility and alignment across independent operational units without requiring heavy top-down mandates. The platform's flexibility allows each plant to manage its own projects while rolling up to a cooperative-wide view.

### Recommended Approach

**Cooperative coordination angle.** "Your cooperative model is your strength — but coordinating projects across semi-autonomous plants is your challenge. IC Project gives every plant its own workspace while giving the cooperative management full visibility."

- **Target persona:** COO or VP of Operations at the cooperative level
- **Entry point:** Pilot in 2-3 plants on a cross-plant project (e.g., new Laciate product launch or certification renewal)
- **Value proposition:** Cooperative-wide project visibility, cross-plant coordination without removing plant autonomy, standardized project processes across the cooperative
- **Pricing context:** 60-100 users at 59-99 PLN = 3,540-9,900 PLN/month

### Key Risk/Challenge

Cooperative governance is slow — Management Board approval may be needed. Grajewo is very remote (northeast Poland near Belarus border) — all initial engagement will be video-based. The decentralized nature that makes IC Project a good fit also makes adoption harder: each plant director must be convinced independently. A top-down mandate from cooperative management helps, but cultural sensitivity to plant autonomy is important.

## 7. Grupa Zywiec (Heineken)

**HQ:** Zywiec, Poland (operations across Poland)
**Size:** ~2,000 employees
**Revenue:** ~3B PLN (~700M EUR)
**Sector Focus:** Poland's premium brewery group. Brands include Zywiec, Warka, Tatra, Desperados (under license). Multiple breweries: Zywiec, Warka, Cieszyn, Elblag, Lezajsk. Heineken subsidiary.

### ICP Score: 72/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 20 | 25 | 2,000 employees, 3B PLN revenue. Multiple breweries. Strong brand portfolio. Deduction: Heineken subsidiary — adds corporate layer. |
| Technographic | 13 | 20 | Heineken likely mandates SAP and specific operational tools globally. Polish operations expected to be on parent's stack. However, local projects (brewery-specific upgrades, local brand initiatives, Polish regulatory compliance) may fall outside global tool coverage. |
| Buying Intent | 24 | 35 | Brewing industry is mature but faces disruption: craft beer competition, changing consumer preferences, sustainability mandates (packaging, water usage, carbon reduction). Each brewery runs modernization projects. Multi-brewery coordination for new brand launches is complex. Moderate intent — constrained by Heineken's tool environment. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Clear structure: Country Managing Director, Operations Director, individual Brewery Directors. Multiple potential champions. Heineken culture values operational excellence — if IC Project proves value, there's cultural alignment. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Heineken subsidiary — procurement involves global approval for tools above certain thresholds. But operational tools at the brewery or department level may stay within Polish management discretion. Dutch corporate culture (Heineken is Dutch) is pragmatic about tool adoption if ROI is clear. |

### Why They Fit

Grupa Zywiec operates 5 breweries across Poland, each with its own production specialties, modernization needs, and local market dynamics. While Heineken provides the global operational framework, the day-to-day coordination of projects within and across Polish breweries — seasonal production planning, brewery modernization projects, new product launches for the Polish market, sustainability initiatives — requires local coordination that global tools may not adequately support.

Brewing is project-intensive: every new beer variety is a product development project (recipe development, trial batches, production scaling, packaging design, marketing campaign, distribution planning). Seasonal production shifts require cross-brewery coordination. Brewery modernization (energy efficiency, capacity expansion) are capital projects running 12-24 months.

### Recommended Approach

**Multi-brewery operations angle.** "You run 5 breweries across Poland with different production profiles. When you launch a new seasonal beer or modernize a brewery, who coordinates across all of them?"

- **Target persona:** Operations Director for Poland or a specific Brewery Director (start at brewery level, expand to cross-brewery)
- **Entry point:** Pilot at one brewery on a modernization or product launch project. Below Heineken global IT radar.
- **Value proposition:** Brewery-level project coordination, cross-brewery seasonal planning, modernization project management
- **Pricing context:** 20-40 users per brewery at 39-79 PLN = 780-3,160 PLN/month per brewery

### Key Risk/Challenge

Heineken corporate IT is the primary blocker. If the engagement surfaces to Amsterdam, it may be shut down. Strategy must stay at the Polish operational level. Also, brewing companies are more digitally mature than meat/dairy — they may already have adequate project tools. Qualify the tech stack early. Zywiec (the town) is in southern Poland — brewery-level engagement requires local travel.

---

## 8. Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi Group)

**HQ:** Poznan, Poland
**Size:** ~2,000 employees
**Revenue:** ~3B PLN (~700M EUR, estimated)
**Sector Focus:** Major Polish brewer. Brands include Tyskie, Lech, Dębowe. 3 major breweries: Tychy, Poznan, Bialystok. Subsidiary of Asahi Group (Japan, via SABMiller acquisition).

### ICP Score: 70/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 20 | 25 | 2,000 employees, ~3B PLN revenue. Three major breweries. Strong market position. Deduction: Asahi subsidiary (via SABMiller) — double corporate layer. |
| Technographic | 12 | 20 | SABMiller legacy (now Asahi) means established IT infrastructure. SAP is nearly certain. Global brewery tools likely mandated. Local tool adoption space is narrower than at Grupa Zywiec. |
| Buying Intent | 23 | 35 | Similar dynamics to Zywiec: seasonal planning, product launches, brewery modernization, sustainability. However, Asahi's Japanese ownership may mean tighter control over tool adoption than Heineken's Dutch pragmatism. Moderate-to-low intent at the corporate level. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Poznan HQ is accessible. Clear management structure. Polish Country Director, Operations Director, and Brewery Directors are potential targets. Asahi's management style may delegate more to local management than expected. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Asahi (Japanese) ownership style tends toward consensus and caution. However, Polish operations may have earned significant autonomy (SABMiller had a decentralized culture, and some of that persists). Procurement for operational tools may stay local. |

### Why They Fit

Kompania Piwowarska mirrors Grupa Zywiec's opportunity with a slightly different corporate dynamic. The SABMiller-to-Asahi ownership transition may have created tool gaps — legacy SABMiller tools being deprecated, Asahi global tools not yet fully rolled out to Polish operations, and a transition period where local teams improvise.

Three breweries (Tychy, Poznan, Bialystok) spread across Poland create cross-brewery coordination needs for seasonal production shifts (summer peaks, holiday specials), brand campaigns that require production coordination, and quality/compliance projects spanning all facilities.

### Recommended Approach

**Transition period opportunity.** "During corporate transitions, local teams often lose tool support before new systems arrive. IC Project fills the gap — fast to deploy, no IT overhead, and works alongside whatever comes next."

- **Target persona:** Operations Director or Head of Supply Chain (Poznan HQ)
- **Entry point:** Cross-brewery seasonal planning or a specific brewery modernization project
- **Value proposition:** Cross-brewery production project coordination, seasonal capacity planning, gap solution during Asahi tool transition
- **Pricing context:** 30-60 users at 39-79 PLN = 1,170-4,740 PLN/month

### Key Risk/Challenge

Double corporate layer (SABMiller legacy + Asahi current) means IT governance may be complex and opaque. If Asahi is rolling out global tools, IC Project would be seen as a competing investment. Timing depends on where Asahi is in their global IT consolidation — if they're mid-rollout, the window is closed. If they're years away from Polish deployment, the window is open. Research this before engaging.

## 9. Mondelez Polska

**HQ:** Warsaw, Poland (offices); major plants in Skarbimierz (near Wroclaw) and Wroclaw
**Size:** ~2,500 employees in Poland
**Revenue:** ~3-4B PLN (~700-930M EUR, Polish operations estimated)
**Sector Focus:** Confectionery and snacks manufacturing. Polish production for Milka, Oreo, Prince Polo, Figaro, Wedel (some brands), and other Mondelez International products.

### ICP Score: 68/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 21 | 25 | 2,500 Polish employees, significant revenue. Major manufacturing operations. Deduction: subsidiary of US multinational (Mondelez International, formerly Kraft). |
| Technographic | 11 | 20 | Mondelez International is a Fortune 500 company with massive IT infrastructure. SAP, Primavera, and potentially proprietary PM tools are standard. Polish manufacturing operations are likely on global systems. Local tool adoption space is very limited. |
| Buying Intent | 21 | 35 | Low corporate intent — global tools are mandated. However, specific operational teams (maintenance engineering, local product adaptation, Polish regulatory compliance) may have needs that fall outside global tool coverage. Niche pain pockets rather than systemic need. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | Large operation with many mid-level managers. Plant Directors (Skarbimierz, Wroclaw), engineering managers, and quality/compliance managers could champion local adoption. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | US corporate culture is process-heavy for tool procurement. Any tool touching manufacturing operations needs approval from global IT. However, tools positioned as "operational aids" below a spending threshold may fly under the radar. |

### Why They Fit

Mondelez Polska is a long-shot target with a specific, narrow opportunity: the gap between global corporate tools and what Polish manufacturing operations teams actually need for day-to-day project coordination. In large multinationals, the global tools excel at portfolio reporting and standardized processes, but local teams handling plant-specific projects (line modifications, local product launches, Polish regulatory compliance, maintenance scheduling) often default to spreadsheets.

The Skarbimierz plant is one of the largest chocolate factories in Europe — it runs constant improvement projects, line changeovers for seasonal products (Christmas, Easter), and capital expenditure projects. These are locally managed and may not have adequate tool support from global systems.

### Recommended Approach

**Plant operations team targeting.** Don't approach Mondelez corporate — target plant operations teams directly with a lightweight "operational coordination" positioning.

- **Target persona:** Plant Director or Engineering Manager at Skarbimierz or Wroclaw plant
- **Entry point:** Maintenance and improvement project coordination for a specific plant. Position as a "team collaboration tool" not a "PM platform" (avoids triggering corporate IT review).
- **Value proposition:** Plant-level project coordination for maintenance schedules, line changeovers, local improvement initiatives. Simple enough that teams adopt without corporate IT involvement.
- **Pricing context:** 15-30 users per plant at 39-59 PLN = 585-1,770 PLN/month — well below corporate procurement thresholds

### Key Risk/Challenge

Highest risk of corporate IT blocking adoption. Mondelez International has a global tool strategy, and any local tool that gains visibility will be reviewed and potentially eliminated. The strategy must stay hyperlocal — one team, one plant, one use case. Also, the deal size is small (15-30 users) relative to the effort required. Only pursue if there's an existing relationship or warm introduction to plant management.

## 10. ArcelorMittal Poland

**HQ:** Dabrowa Gornicza, Poland (with plants across Silesia and Lesser Poland)
**Size:** ~10,000 employees
**Revenue:** ~10-15B PLN (~2.3-3.5B EUR, estimated)
**Sector Focus:** Poland's largest steel producer. Integrated steel production (blast furnaces + electric arc furnaces). Plants in Dabrowa Gornicza, Krakow, Sosnowiec, Swietochlowice, Zdzieszowice, Chorzow. Subsidiary of ArcelorMittal (Luxembourg, world's largest steelmaker).

### ICP Score: 65/100 (Tier 2)

| Dimension | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Firmographic | 22 | 25 | 10,000 employees, massive revenue. Largest steel producer in Poland. Multiple plants across Silesia. Scale is impressive. Major deduction: subsidiary of world's largest steelmaker — extremely structured corporate IT. |
| Technographic | 10 | 20 | ArcelorMittal corporate has comprehensive IT: SAP, MES, SCADA, proprietary tools for steel production. Manufacturing operations are heavily instrumented. Project coordination tools are likely part of the global stack. Very limited space for local tools. |
| Buying Intent | 18 | 35 | Low corporate buying intent for PM tools — they have enterprise solutions. However, specific departments (maintenance engineering, capex project management, environmental compliance) may have coordination needs that fall outside production-focused tools. Steel plants run massive capex projects (blast furnace relines, emission reduction investments) that need project coordination. |
| Persona Mapping | 8 | 10 | 10,000 employees means many potential champions. Capex project managers, maintenance engineering heads, environmental compliance managers are targets. People managing 50M+ PLN projects on spreadsheets exist in companies this large. |
| Engagement Readiness | 7 | 10 | Luxembourg corporate governs IT strategy. Polish operations have limited tool autonomy. However, capex/maintenance project teams may have departmental budgets for operational tools. Environmental compliance is a growing, under-tooled area in steel. |

### Why They Fit

ArcelorMittal Poland is the lowest-priority target on this list, but the opportunity is real — just narrow. Steel plants are operationally optimized for production (MES, SCADA, Level 2 automation), but the projects that happen alongside production are often managed with surprisingly basic tools. A blast furnace reline is a 200M+ PLN project spanning 6-12 months with hundreds of contractors, thousands of activities, and critical path dependencies. An environmental upgrade to meet EU Green Deal requirements is a multi-year, multi-plant initiative.

These are not "production" — they're projects. And in heavy industry, the gap between production technology sophistication and project management tool sophistication is often vast. The maintenance engineer who monitors a blast furnace with million-dollar sensors may be tracking their shutdown project in Excel.

### Recommended Approach

**Capex and maintenance project targeting.** Don't try to sell to production or corporate IT. Target the teams managing capital investment and maintenance projects — they have the biggest gap between project complexity and tool sophistication.

- **Target persona:** Head of Capex Projects, Chief Maintenance Engineer, or Environmental Compliance Director
- **Entry point:** One major capex project (e.g., a blast furnace reline, emission reduction installation, or plant modernization). Offer IC Project as the coordination platform for the project.
- **Value proposition:** "Your blast furnace runs on world-class technology. Your blast furnace reline runs on spreadsheets. IC Project brings the same level of coordination to your capex projects."
- **Pricing context:** 30-50 users on a capex project team at 59-99 PLN = 1,770-4,950 PLN/month — invisible against a 200M PLN project budget

### Key Risk/Challenge

ArcelorMittal Luxembourg IT governance is the primary blocker. Any tool that touches plant operations will be reviewed. Position IC Project purely as a "project team collaboration tool" for specific capex/maintenance projects — not as a "manufacturing PM platform." Even then, corporate IT may block it. The deal size (30-50 users) is small relative to the enterprise sales effort required. Only pursue with a warm introduction to a capex project director, not through cold outreach. The investment in pursuing this account may not justify the return unless it opens the door to other ArcelorMittal plants globally — in which case, the Polish pilot becomes a strategic reference.

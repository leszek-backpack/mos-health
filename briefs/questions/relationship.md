# Discovery Questions — Relationship / Advisor Meeting

**Goal:** Learn from benefits advisors, HR consultants, and industry partners. Frame as "what to learn" not "what to pitch."

## Section 1: Market & Positioning (10-12 min)

1. **"Based on what you just heard about Mos Health, how would you categorize us in the benefits landscape? Where do we sit in the market?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "Are we competing with point solutions like Calm or Gympass, platforms like Virgin Pulse, or something else entirely?"
   - *Follow-up:* "What category do employers already have budget for that we'd be pulling from?"

2. **"We're positioning this as 'the foundation that makes other wellness programs work better' — does that resonate with how employers think?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "Should we position as standalone benefit or complementary layer?"
   - *Follow-up:* "What positioning have you seen work for new benefits entering crowded markets?"

3. **"Have you seen anyone try something similar to Mos Health? What happened to them?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "What made them succeed or fail?"

## Section 2: Pricing & Budget (8-10 min)

4. **"We're pricing at $95 per employee per month, which includes a +1 family member. Honest reaction — too high, too low, or reasonable?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "What's the price sensitivity threshold for companies our size [50-500 employees]?"
   - *Follow-up:* "How do employers typically think about wellness spend per employee?"

5. **"We're including the +1 family member in the base price. Smart differentiator or are we leaving money on the table?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "Should family access be an upsell or is it a hook for adoption?"

## Section 3: Buying Process & Sales (12-15 min)

6. **"Who's the actual buyer for something like this — CEO, Head of People, Benefits Manager, or someone else?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "Who typically initiates these conversations vs. who signs the contract?"
   - *Follow-up:* "How many stakeholders are usually involved in the decision?"

7. **"What does a realistic sales cycle look like for our target market [50-500 employees]?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "What makes deals move fast vs. drag out for months?"
   - *Follow-up:* "Are there seasonal buying windows we should know about?"

8. **"What are the top 3 objections we'll hear from employers?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "How do successful companies handle 'we already have wellness programs'?"
   - *Follow-up:* "What about 'we need to see ROI data first'?"

9. **"How do we prove ROI without years of data? What proof points actually move deals forward?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "Do buyers actually care about productivity metrics or is it more about employee satisfaction?"
   - *Follow-up:* "What success metrics should we track from day 1?"

## Section 4: Distribution & Go-to-Market (8-10 min)

10. **"Should we be selling direct to employers initially, or building partnerships with brokers/consultants like yourself?"**
    - *Follow-up:* "What channel mix have you seen work for companies at our stage?"
    - *Follow-up:* "When is the right time to pursue consultant relationships?"

11. **"For pilot programs — what terms have you seen work to get companies to try something new?"**
    - *Follow-up:* "Free pilots, discounted, or full price from day 1?"
    - *Follow-up:* "How long should a pilot be to get real signal?"

## Section 5: Operational Reality & Retention (8-10 min)

12. **"We're planning in-office supplement displays with bi-weekly restocking. Does that model make sense or is it a red flag?"**
    - *Follow-up:* "Have you seen physical distribution models work at scale?"
    - *Follow-up:* "What operational nightmares am I not seeing yet?"

13. **"What makes employers actually renew wellness benefits vs. churn after year 1?"**
    - *Follow-up:* "Is it utilization rates, employee feedback, measured outcomes, or something else?"

## Section 6: The "What Am I Missing?" Question (3 min)

14. **"What am I not asking that I should be asking?"**
    - *This is critical — gives them space to share unexpected insights*

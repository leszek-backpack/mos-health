# Persona Development

## When to Use
- Building outbound campaigns for a new persona or title
- Copy is getting opens but not replies (persona-message mismatch)
- Expanding from one buyer persona to multiple within the same account
- Training AI systems or SDRs on how to speak to specific personas

## Framework

### Persona vs. ICP: The Difference

**ICP** = the company you should target (firmographics, technographics, intent signals)
**Persona** = the person within that company you should contact (role, pain, motivation)

You need both. An ICP without personas means you're emailing companies, not people. A persona without an ICP means you're reaching the right person at the wrong company.

### The Persona Blueprint: 8 Components

Every actionable persona contains these eight elements:

#### 1. Identity Profile

| Field | What to Capture | Example |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Title patterns** | All variations of the title they hold | VP of Sales, Vice President Sales, VP Revenue, Head of Sales |
| **Seniority band** | Their level in the org | VP / Director / C-Suite |
| **Department** | Where they sit | Sales, Revenue, Growth |
| **Reports to** | Their boss's title | CRO, CEO, COO |
| **Team size** | How many people they manage | 5-30 direct reports |
| **Tenure** | How long they've typically held the role | 1-3 years (relevant for "new in role" trigger) |
| **LinkedIn keywords** | Phrases in their headline or About | "building pipeline," "scaling revenue," "B2B growth" |

**Why title patterns matter:** If your email platform matches on exact titles, you'll miss 40-60% of your audience. "VP of Sales" and "Vice President, Revenue" might be the same person. Capture every variant.

#### 2. The Day-in-the-Life Map

Understand what this persona's week actually looks like:

| Time Block | Activity | Frustration | Opportunity |
|------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Monday AM | Pipeline review, forecasting | Numbers never match CRM data | "Is your pipeline review still a spreadsheet exercise?" |
| Monday PM | Team 1:1s | Reps aren't hitting activity targets | "Most VP Sales spend Monday fixing last week's problems" |
| Tuesday-Thursday | Deals, strategy, internal meetings | No time for strategic work | "When did you last have a full day for strategy?" |
| Friday | Reporting to CRO/CEO | Scrambling to build the narrative | "Friday afternoon report assembly shouldn't take 3 hours" |

**How to use this:** Your email should land during a moment of relevant frustration. If you're selling pipeline tools, send Tuesday morning — not Friday afternoon when they're already in reporting mode.

#### 3. Pain Hierarchy (Ranked)

Not all pains are equal. Rank them by urgency and budget authority:

| Rank | Pain Category | Specific Pain | Urgency | Budget Authority |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| **P1** | Revenue | "We're going to miss our number this quarter" | Critical | Full authority |
| **P2** | Efficiency | "My reps spend 60% of their time on non-selling activities" | High | Needs approval |
| **P3** | Visibility | "I can't tell which deals are real and which are happy ears" | Medium-High | Can champion |
| **P4** | Talent | "I'm losing good reps to companies with better tools" | Medium | Shared decision |
| **P5** | Process | "We don't have a documented sales playbook" | Medium-Low | Low priority |

**Rule:** Always lead your outreach with P1 or P2 pains. P3-P5 are follow-up angles for later steps in the sequence.

#### 4. Motivation Map

What drives this persona personally and professionally:

| Motivation Type | What They Want | How to Reference It |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Career** | Get promoted to CRO/CEO within 2 years | "The VPs who get promoted to CRO are the ones who..." |
| **Team** | Build a winning team they're proud of | "Your reps' success reflects directly on you" |
| **Recognition** | Be seen as the leader who scaled revenue | "When you present the board deck, what story do you want to tell?" |
| **Control** | Predictable pipeline, not hope-based forecasting | "Replace 'I think we'll hit our number' with 'I know we will'" |
| **Efficiency** | More output with the same headcount | "Add $2M pipeline without adding headcount" |

**Key insight:** People buy for personal reasons and justify with business reasons. Your email hook should tap the personal motivation. Your proof points should satisfy the business justification.

#### 5. Buying Behavior Profile

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|------------|
| **Research style** | Where do they go to evaluate solutions? (G2, peers, LinkedIn, events) |
| **Decision speed** | Fast (days-weeks) or slow (months)? What slows them down? |
| **Risk tolerance** | Early adopter or "show me the case study first"? |
| **Champion or buyer** | Do they sign the check, or do they sell internally to someone who does? |
| **Objection pattern** | What they say when they're interested but cautious (see Objection Mining skill) |
| **Preferred communication** | Email, LinkedIn DM, phone call, or in-person? |
| **Meeting format** | 15-min intro, 30-min demo, or 60-min deep dive? |

#### 6. Language Profile

The exact words and phrases this persona uses to describe their problems:

| Category | Their Language | NOT Your Language |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Problem** | "We can't fill the top of the funnel" | "Your demand generation needs optimization" |
| **Goal** | "I need more pipeline, fast" | "Accelerate revenue acquisition velocity" |
| **Frustration** | "My reps are guessing" | "Your team lacks data-driven insights" |
| **Success** | "We crushed our number" | "Revenue targets were exceeded" |
| **Evaluation** | "Does it actually work?" | "What's the ROI methodology?" |

**How to build this:** Read their LinkedIn posts. Listen to their podcast appearances. Scan sales call transcripts. The phrases they use repeatedly ARE your copy.

#### 7. Anti-Persona Signals (Disqualifiers)

Just as important as knowing who to target is knowing who to skip:

| Signal | Why It's a DQ |
|--------|--------------|
| "We handle this in-house" (in LinkedIn bio) | Not looking to outsource |
| Title includes "Interim" or "Fractional" | Temporary, won't start new vendor relationships |
| Company is in hiring freeze | No budget for new tools |
| LinkedIn activity shows they just implemented a competitor | Wrong timing — wait 12-18 months |
| Title is too senior for your product (CEO at 10K+ company) | Won't personally evaluate, delegates too many layers down |
| Title is too junior (SDR, BDR, Account Executive) | Can't champion, can't buy |

#### 8. Competitive Landscape (Per Persona)

What other solutions does this persona consider?

| Category | Competitors | How to Position Against |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Direct competitors** | Tools/services that do what you do | "Unlike {{competitor}}, we..." (use sparingly) |
| **Indirect competitors** | Different approaches to the same problem | "You could hire 3 more reps OR..." |
| **Status quo** | Doing nothing / current manual process | "The spreadsheet approach works until it doesn't" |
| **Internal build** | Building their own solution | "Most teams that build it themselves spend 6 months and end up with 60% of what they need" |

### Multi-Persona Account Strategy

For B2B deals, you rarely sell to one person. Map the buying committee:

```
Account: {{companyName}}
├── Economic Buyer (signs the check)
│   └── CRO / VP Sales — lead with ROI and revenue impact
│
├── Champion (sells internally for you)
│   └── Director of Sales / RevOps Lead — lead with ease and efficiency
│
├── Influencer (shapes the evaluation)
│   └── Sales Manager / Team Lead — lead with day-to-day pain relief
│
├── Blocker (can kill the deal)
│   └── IT / Security / Finance — lead with compliance and risk reduction
│
└── End User (will use the product daily)
    └── SDR / AE — lead with "this makes your job easier"
```

**Sequencing strategy:**
1. Start with the Champion (most responsive, lowest risk)
2. Get the Champion to introduce you to the Economic Buyer
3. Address the Blocker proactively (send them the security doc before they ask)
4. Never cold-email the End User in enterprise deals — they can't buy

### Building Personas from Data (Not Assumptions)

Most persona docs are fiction. Here's how to build from evidence:

#### Source 1: Win/Loss Analysis
- Interview 5-10 customers who bought: Why did they buy? What almost stopped them?
- Interview 5-10 prospects who didn't buy: What would have changed their mind?
- Look for the patterns in both sets

#### Source 2: Sales Call Transcripts
- Pull 20+ discovery call transcripts
- Extract: pain points mentioned, language used, questions asked, objections raised
- Frequency analysis: which pains come up in 70%+ of calls?

#### Source 3: LinkedIn and Content Analysis
- Read 50+ LinkedIn posts from people with your target title
- What topics do they engage with? What do they complain about? What do they celebrate?
- The intersection of "what they post about" and "what you solve" = your opening angle

#### Source 4: CRM Data
- Which titles have the highest close rate?
- Which titles have the shortest sales cycle?
- Which titles generate the highest deal value?
- This tells you WHO to prioritize, not just WHO to contact

#### Source 5: Customer Support and Success
- What do existing customers of this persona type ask for most?
- What features do they use/not use?
- What language do they use in support tickets?

## Tips
- Interview at least 5 real humans with this title before finalizing the persona. Reading LinkedIn posts is research. Talking to them is validation.
- The best persona insight usually comes from the question: "What did you try before us?" Their previous failed solution reveals the real pain better than any survey.
- Personas decay. A VP Sales persona from 2023 is different from 2026 — the market has shifted, priorities change, new tools emerge. Refresh annually.
- Don't over-segment. 2-3 well-researched personas beat 8 shallow ones. You need enough depth to write copy that resonates, not just enough categories to feel organized.
- If your persona and your anti-persona look similar on paper, your persona isn't specific enough. Keep narrowing until a stranger could tell them apart from the description alone.

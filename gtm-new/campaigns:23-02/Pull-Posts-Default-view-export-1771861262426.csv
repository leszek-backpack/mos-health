“Can you sanity-check our plan?”
“Does this quota make sense?”
“Are we missing something obvious?”

These calls come every January.
From friends.
From customers.
From people at companies I don’t even work with.

And it’s not because they’re lazy or careless.

It’s the opposite.

They know compensation is strategic.
They know it shapes behavior, cost of sales, trust, and retention.
And they don’t want to improvise it.

The real problem is simpler — and harder.

There is no public, trusted playbook for comp.

Most plans are confidential.
Highly context-specific.
Tied to a very particular GTM motion, maturity stage, and risk profile.

So you can’t just copy “what others do.”

What’s left?

A few close-network conversations.
1:1 Zooms with people who’ve “seen some stuff.”
And generic internet or AI answers that ignore nuance and context.

When leaders call, they’re not asking for perfection.

They’re looking for someone who’s seen enough plans to say:
“You’re not crazy — this fits your motion.”
Or:
“This will blow up in three months.”

They want a second opinion on a high-stakes decision — without flying blind on behavior, cost of sales, or fairness.

What still surprises me is this:

We have data for everything else.
Pipeline.
Forecasting.
Pricing.
Headcount.

But most comp plans are still designed via Zoom calls and spreadsheets.

No simulations.
No real trade-off visibility.
No system-level feedback loop.

If you’re tweaking your 2026 comp plan right now…

What are you using as your “second opinion”?
Data, tech — or just a few trusted phone calls?","Sergio Gonzalez Gaspar","activity","urn:li:share:7426584612186984449","2025-11-22","Valid 7426584615240491008","ACoAAAVtYaIBzPZvBGyyAt6tU92JQ-GAfEUOlUo","ACwAAAVt","ACwAABdBI4EB4PPSyZ3YveNlsH2pyRqlbCaF7Dw","ACwAABdB","✅ Record Found","false",,false

And then stop halfway.

Because the finance brain beats the behaviour brain.

I recently spoke with a team that had escaped a jungle of manual calculations.
They landed on a clean, elegant model.

On paper, it was perfect.

In reality, it was built for safety, not motivation.

There was:
• No real upside
• No meaningful differentiation
• No moment where a rep thought,
“If I crush this, it really matters.”

The plan reduced errors.
It reduced risk.
But it also reduced ambition.

So I asked them one question:

“What behaviour would you be genuinely happy to overpay commissions on?”

That question changes the entire conversation.

Because comp plans don’t just pay outcomes.
They signal what the business wants more of.

If your model is optimised only for control,
don’t be surprised when it produces flat behaviour.

If you realised your comp plan is “safe but flat”,
what would you change first:
thresholds, tiers, or accelerators?","Sergio Gonzalez Gaspar","activity","urn:li:share:7422233490445893632","2025-11-22","Valid 7422233492194979841","ACoAAAVtYaIBzPZvBGyyAt6tU92JQ-GAfEUOlUo","ACwAAAVt","ACwAABdBI4EB4PPSyZ3YveNlsH2pyRqlbCaF7Dw","ACwAABdB","✅ Record Found","false",,false

💻 Hvordan kan KI få en reell effekt? 
 
❓Og hva etterlyser KI-leverandørene selv?
 
Dette var noe av det KI-leverandører svarte på i et innspillsmøte med Jan Christian Vestre og Karianne Tung, i regi av Norway Health Tech og Digital Norway.
 
Noen stikkord var: 
👾 tilgang til kvalitetssikrede kunnskapskilder og helsedata,
👾 at innkjøpssystemet i helseforetakene forenkles 
👾 og at forutsetningene for å skalere blir bedre. 
 
– KI er en viktig del av løsningen for en helsetjeneste som sliter med ressurser. Derfor må vi bredde ut det som fungerer. Regjeringen skal fjerne hindre og tilrettelegge for denne utviklingen, sa Vestre.
 
– Vi må lykkes med å ta i bruk KI i helsetjenesten. Det kan gi oss bedre pasientbehandling og mer effektiv bruk av offentlige ressurser. Nå gjelder det å gå fra ambisjon til adopsjon, sier Tung.
 
Offentlige kunder fra blant andre Helse Sør-Øst RHF, Helse Vest, Helse Midt-Norge RHF og Helse Nord RHF, Sykehjemsetaten, Oslo kommune var også til stede.

Already have solid DSO relationships. Know their regions well. Still signed up for Engrate's Power Tariff API. Why? 



Because even when you understand the tariffs, the data is ""overwhelming and hard to structure"". This is the pattern we keep seeing. It's not about lack of knowledge. It's about the format. 

You can have great DSO contacts and deep regional expertise. But when you're trying to feed that information into optimization algorithms, spreadsheets and PDF tariff documents don't cut it.

Machine-readability changes everything. That's the shift. From knowing the information to having it in a format that lets you actually build with it.

But when you look a little deeper, the Swedish story goes beyond flashy breakthrough models. It is about smart and precise entry into real industries.

If you look at Endra, you see the difference immediately. They are going deep into MEP design in construction, which is a traditional, highly regulated and complex field. Instead of building something on top of the market, they are embedding themselves inside Revit and within the actual engineering workflow. That is real vertical AI, not a decorative layer.

Or Engrate in energy. On the surface, it sounds like just another API. But the Swedish energy market is fragmented and data heavy. The ability to aggregate data across transmission points and make it usable for smart applications is infrastructure thinking, not just an app.

Even companies like Dentio or Vetnio (YC W25) are not simply chatbots for doctors. They are integrating into clinical workflows, documentation, compliance and privacy. When you build correctly within GDPR and a strict European regulatory environment, you are building a foundation that can scale globally.

And maybe what is most interesting is the speed. Companies founded in 2024 or 2025 already have products and integrations. That tells you something about an ecosystem that can move from a focused idea to an industrial solution very quickly.

So yes, each company on its own might not look like a sparkly revolution.

But as a pattern, it is a different story.

Sweden is building AI that is embedded deep inside the real economy.

Not another abstract tech vision.

But practical, vertical infrastructure with clear business value.

And to me, that is far more interesting.

Hur får vi maximal effekt av effekttarifferna som nu införs? 

Teorin är enkel: Effekttariffer ska driva smartare energianvändning. I praktiken är det betydligt krångligare. Att ändra beteenden tar tid, men att programmera maskiner går snabbt. Med kalkylerbar och maskinläsbar data kan såväl optimeringsalgoritmer som energitjänster göra skillnad redan idag.

På mötet idag presenterade Richard Eklund vår produkt Effektavgifter. I den har vi tagit optimeringslogiken ett steg längre än RISE Research Institutes of Swedens API. Resultatet är 100% deterministiska prismodeller. Inte ""nästan rätt"", så att våra kunder kan börja optimera direkt. 

Det coolaste? Diskussionerna idag visade att viljan att lösa det här finns. Nätbolagen ser behovet av att göra det enkelt för kunderna. För vi kan inte vänta. Sveriges energianvändare behöver kunna optimera nu.

And it has nothing to do with the formulas.

It happens in the rollout meeting.

Here’s what a plan that will work looks like.

The room is mostly quiet.
People nod.
There’s visible relief.

The questions reps ask are about action and strategy:
“How should I prioritize my pipeline?”
“What do I need to do to hit the top tier?”
“Where should I focus my time?”

You can almost hear it:
“Finally, this makes sense.”

Now compare that to a plan that won’t work.

The meeting gets stuck in edge cases.
Micro-math.
Clarifications on basic mechanics.

“So do I actually get paid on X?”
“What happens if this deal slips?”
“Wait, how is this calculated again?”

And the biggest red flag of all?

Managers leave saying:
“We’ll explain it later”
“We’ll solve it on a case by case” 
“We’ll decide it when it happens”

That sentence tells you everything.

This 10-minute test isn’t about communication skills.
It’s a symptom of design quality.

When CRO, CFO, and CEO have aligned the plan around:
• strategy
• motivation
• financial logic

…the explanation comes out naturally simple.

When the plan is a patchwork of compromises, assumptions, and last-minute fixes, the confusion shows up immediately.

Clarity and emotional buy-in at rollout are leading indicators.
Confusion and anxiety are lagging ones.

I get this question all the time.
And my honest answer is: I have no idea.

If you show me your commission rates before you show me your context, I have zero opinion.

This is the worst question I get: “Is 10% commission good?”

With no context at all.

I have one non-negotiable before I touch any comp plan:

I refuse to judge percentages, splits, or accelerators until I understand how the business actually works.

Without context, any recommendation is just a smart-sounding guess.

At a minimum, I need to understand two things.

On the GTM side:
• Business model (i.e. SaaS, consumption based, GMV based, etc.)
 •ACV and deal distribution
• Sales cycle length
• Sales channel (i.e. outbound, inbound, partner/indirect sales)
• Who owns renewals and expansion
• Role structure (hunters, farmers, hybrids)
• Mix of new vs existing revenue

On the business side:
• 2026 goals: growth, profitability, or both
• Margin realities
• How much risk leadership is genuinely willing to take
• What team behaviour from last year you want to keep (if any)
• Which one you want to change (if any)

Only then does “10%” start to mean anything.

This is where most generic advice — and most templates — fall apart.

They jump straight to mechanics:
→ 50/50 vs 60/40
→ Tiers
→ Caps
→ Accelerators

All before understanding the story underneath.

That’s how teams end up with beautiful plans on paper…
that are completely misaligned with how they actually sell.

Comp is downstream of context.
If your context changes and your plan doesn’t, performance will.

Next time you ask anyone — including AI — for comp advice, try this:
Spend 80% of your message on context and 20% on the question.

You’ll be surprised how different the answer is.

This was our first office.

No logo.
No roadmap.
No idea if this would actually work.

Just me, Iván, and Matias trying to solve a problem we had lived ourselves.

At the time, Remuner was nothing.
No customers.
No product.
No guarantees.

What we did have was conviction.

We had seen how broken sales compensation really was:
• Comp plans nobody understood
• Commissions calculated in messy spreadsheets (or Manu’s post-its stuck all over his desk to track incentives)
• Endless disputes between sales, finance, and leadership
• Incentives that pushed the wrong behaviors

Fun fact: we literally shared one screen between the three of us to work together.

No fancy setup. Just one laptop, one problem, and a lot of opinions.

So we started here.
Talking.
Arguing.
Sketching.
Breaking ideas.
Rebuilding them again.

Not thinking about “scaling” or “fundraising”.
Just obsessed with one question:

How do you design compensation that actually works in the real world?

Looking at this photo now, I’m reminded of something important:

Most companies don’t fail because they lacked ambition.
They fail because they didn’t stay close enough to the real problem.

This room forced us to stay close.
To listen.
To be practical.
To earn every small step forward.

For years, I’ve seen incredible revenue leaders across Madrid and Barcelona…
But too often, they’re solving the same problems in isolation.

→ Messy data across tools.
→ Forecasts that change every week.
→ Sales, marketing and finance misaligned on the same numbers.
→ Compensation plans that create friction instead of clarity.

That’s why I’m excited to share that, in partnership with RevOps Co-op, we’re launching the Spain Chapter 🥳 

RevOps Co-op has built one of the strongest global communities of operators. But this isn’t just about events.

 Here’s what the Spain Chapter actually means 👇

🔹 Regular in-person meetups (casual, operator-led, no pitch decks)
🔹 A private Spain-only Slack channel inside RevOps Co-op
🔹 Peer-to-peer matching so RevOps leaders in Spain can connect directly
🔹 Community programming built by operators, for operators

Now it’s time to bring that energy to Spain — and create a space where revenue leaders can connect, share real challenges, and learn from each other.

We’re kicking things off with:

📍 Madrid Happy Hour – March 10th
📍 RevOps Breakfast Club (Madrid) – March 12th
📍 Barcelona Happy Hour – March 17th

This isn’t a conference. It’s not a sales event. It’s real conversations with people building and scaling revenue engines every day.

Remuner is proud to sponsor and support the Spain chapter from day one and internationally, events like RevOps AF in London — where we’re proud sponsors (stay tuned 😉). 

Building better revenue organizations starts with building better conversations. Thanks to Matthew Volm and the ROC team for making this possible.

If you’re a RevOps leader, Head of Sales, Commercial Excellence, founder, or revenue operator in Spain — you’ll want to be in the room.

Stay tuned for more details about each event very soon.

We talked about something founders often underestimate until it’s too late:
how early decisions around structure, tax, and incentives quietly shape your ability to scale.

A few reflections I’m taking away from the panel:

• scaling isn’t just about growth. It’s about designing the company so growth doesn’t break you later
• equity, incentives, and compensation plans are strategic tools, not just HR or legal topics
• getting the right advice early is almost always cheaper than fixing things post-Series A (or pre-exit)

Great discussion alongside David Alonso Martinez, CEO of Zinco, Xavi Pont Martin, co-founder and chairman of Fundación Ship2B and managing partner at Ship2B Ventures and the KPMG team who made it happen.

And most importantly: a very engaged room asking the right questions — the ones that usually come right before things get complex.

In our first all-hands of 2026, we did two things at once.

We set an ambitious direction for the year.
And we openly named our big “bets” — the areas with real unknowns.

New motions.
New priorities.
Things we believe in, but don’t yet fully control.

The key part?
We called them bets instead of selling them as certainties.

People can handle uncertainty when you’re honest about it.

But there’s one area where we don’t bet: compensation.

We keep comp transparent and predictable.
We avoid anchoring pay to untested assumptions.
And we’re explicit upfront: if reality shifts, we’ll adjust the plan — not pretend the original model was flawless.

That line matters more than most leaders realize.

It keeps ambition high.
But it also keeps people grounded.

Reps know exactly what’s expected of them.
They know how they’ll be measured.
And they know the difference between:

“We’re betting on this motion”
and
“Your paycheck depends on a guess.”

Your team can handle bets.
What they can’t handle is pretending everything is certain while tying their income to leadership’s guesses.

That’s what a sales leader texted me recently.
What stood out wasn’t the statement itself.

It was the relief behind it.

This wasn’t someone ideologically opposed to incentives.
He understands how powerful variable comp can be.

But after years of living with commissions, he was tired.

Tired of over-engineered plans with endless exceptions.
Tired of Excel chaos and manual reconciliations.
Tired of month-end tribunals between Sales, Finance, and HR.
Tired of reps feeling things were unfair or opaque — even when everyone had good intentions.

So he did the one thing that guaranteed peace.

He turned commissions off.

In that moment, “no commissions” wasn’t a strategy.
It was self-protection.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth:

The enemy isn’t variable compensation.
It’s how we usually implement it.

→ Over-complicated rules.
→ Spreadsheet-based processes.
→ Poor communication.
→ And zero trust in the numbers.

All of that drains time.
And even more importantly, it drains emotional energy.

But there’s a hidden trade-off in killing commissions.

You give up your strongest lever to steer behaviour at scale.
You lose the ability to reward the right actions at the right time.
And when markets get tougher, you’ve removed one of your highest-impact growth tools.

Short-term relief.
Long-term cost.

There’s another path most teams never get to.

→ Simple, aligned rules that connect company goals to what gets rewarded.
→ Transparent plans reps can actually explain to each other.
→ And a trusted system that automates calculations — so Sales, Finance, and HR stop fighting the spreadsheet.

With those in place, you keep the behavioural power of variable comp…
without the old chaos.

So if you’ve ever felt tempted to say “no commissions, no problem”…

Teaching people the real problem the company is trying to solve.

Last week I ran an in-depth “Compensation Plans 101” onboarding session with 2 new team meambers:
Jesús Real who is joining us as Head of Product and Marta Peña as Product Designer.

It was meant to be a small session.

But once people heard what we were actually digging into, more team members asked to join.

Because this wasn’t about commissions.

It was about understanding the problem we exist to solve.

We talked about things most non-sales roles never get proper exposure to:

– why compensation plans break as companies scale
– how incentives shape behaviour (often in unintended ways)
– where misalignment between sales, product and finance really comes from
– why “simple” compensation is incredibly hard to get right
– and why transparency matters more than clever mechanics

If teams don’t understand the problem deeply, they end up building solutions in isolation.

And that’s how you get great execution… in the wrong direction.

They feel scientific.
And nobody actually believes them.

The biggest mistake I see:
Treating a new motion like a mature one.

Same quota logic.
Same benchmarks.
Same “industry standards”.

Year one is not about perfect attainment.

It’s about learning velocity and behaviour.

A more honest approach for new motions:

1️⃣ Declare assumptions explicitly
What must be true for this quota to make sense?

2️⃣ Shorten quota cycles
Quarterly (or even monthly) beats annual fantasy.

3️⃣ Overweight leading indicators
Activity indicators, pipeline quality, deal progression, ICP fit.

4️⃣ Pre-schedule a Q1/Q2 recalibration
Not as a failure. As part of the design.

If the motion is new, pretending the quota is “real” can be more dangerous than missing it.

So what’s worse in your experience:

Under-attainment… or a quota nobody actually believes in?","Sergio Gonzalez Gaspar","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7417889578021289984","2025-11-22","Valid 7417889578021289984","ACoAAAVtYaIBzPZvBGyyAt6tU92JQ-GAfEUOlUo","ACwAAAVt","ACwAAAVtYaIBt4kAdFvvjnWSL3Y_4mrj9vTypr8","ACwAAAVt","✅ Record Found","true",,false

is often designed with less rigor than your pricing page.

→ Your incentive plan.

Think about the paradox.

Teams obsess over:
• ICP
• Funnel design
• Messaging
• Pricing

But commissions?

They usually get built like this:
→ A few rushed meetings
→ Finance + HR
→ Last year’s spreadsheet
→ “We’ll fix it next quarter”

What I see all the time:

Comp plans copied from “similar” companies
→ With no adaptation

Quarterly tweaks
– No behavioural thesis

Incentives that reward outcomes
→ Not the behaviours behind them

No incentive ROI
→ Revenue per € of commission paid

And then leaders are surprised when:
• AEs are sandbagging deals
• Reps chase the wrong deals
• Pipeline quality drops
• Productivity stalls

This isn’t an incentives problem.
It’s a GTM problem.

Incentives are not admin.

They’re one of the strongest levers you have to:
- Shape behaviour
- Direct focus
- Turn strategy into execution

Honest question:

When was the last time you treated incentive design as a GTM decision
– not just something that had to be “done”?","Sergio Gonzalez Gaspar","activity","urn:li:share:7417160520648040449","2025-11-22","Valid 7417160521705099264","ACoAAAVtYaIBzPZvBGyyAt6tU92JQ-GAfEUOlUo","ACwAAAVt","ACwAAAVtYaIBt4kAdFvvjnWSL3Y_4mrj9vTypr8","ACwAAAVt","✅ Record Found","true",,false

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7415368229142900737","Yes","Money drives behaviour. Full stop.

Every compensation plan either accepts that reality
or fights it.

And the plan never wins.

When 30–60% of someone’s pay is variable, you’re not “incentivising”.
You’re programming behaviour.

Every line in the plan sends a signal:

→ Caps don’t control cost. They push deals into next quarter.
→ Accelerators don’t “reward excellence”. They pull deals forward at any cost.
→ Clawbacks don’t protect the company. They change risk appetite.
→ Exceptions don’t solve edge cases. They create shadow rules.

Yet I still hear leaders say:
“Reps won’t optimise for that.”

They will.
They always do.

Not because they’re bad actors.
Because they’re rational.

I see the same patterns over and over:

→ Activity bonuses inflate noise, not revenue
→ Opaque rules create shadow spreadsheets and permanent distrust
→ Artificial caps turn top performers into expert time-managers
→ Overlapping metrics create internal trade-offs no one intended
→ “Temporary” SPIFFs quietly become the real comp plan

Then leadership is surprised when behaviour drifts.

“We wanted quality, but we got volume.”
“We wanted long-term value, but we got quarter-end games.”
“We wanted collaboration, but we got optimisation.”

None of that is a sales problem.

It’s a design problem.

Leaders say money drives behaviour.
Then design plans as if it doesn’t.

A simple test I like to use:

If someone studied your comp plan with zero context,
no culture deck,
no values slide,
no leadership speeches…

What behaviours would they assume you actually want?

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7414622168858185729","Yes","4 months ago, we closed our €5,5M seed round.

Here's the one thing I told every founder who asked for advice:

Choose your investors like you choose your co-founders.

Most founders don’t realize this early on:
your investors are part of the team.

They’re not in the office every day.
They’re not in Slack or sitting in pipeline reviews.

But they own a piece of what you’re building.

They influence decisions.
And you’re going to be working side-by-side with them for the next 10 years.

So when we raised €5,5M for Remuner, I approached it differently than I had in my 20s.

Here’s how I thought about it:

1. Investors I already knew

Some came from previous companies.
I’d seen them in real situations:

- Board calls when we missed revenue
- Restructuring moments nobody enjoys
- Tough conversations where things weren’t going our way

That experienced mattered above everything.

It showed me how they behaved when things were hard, not just when things were exciting.

2. Investors I met while building

Others I met at events, grabbed coffees with, and stayed in touch with over years.

No pitch. No ask. Just great conversations.

And you learn a lot from that:

- Who follows up
- Who you never hear from again
- Who sends something helpful out of nowhere
- Who only shows interest when things look shiny

Early behaviour always repeats later.

3. New investors we didn’t know yet

For them, we went deep on references.
Not the curated ones they want you to call.
I reached out to founders who had them on their cap table.

I only asked two questions:

1️⃣ Would you let them invest again?
2️⃣ Tell me a moment when things went badly - how did they behave?

That second question helps you make your decision.

Anyone is supportive when you're growing fast.
The real test is who they are when you’re not.

What I was looking for: Alignment.

Not on metrics or pricing or growth rates, because those change every year.

I looked for alignment on:

- How we treat people
- How we think about long-term value
- How we make decisions under pressure
- How patient they are with the messy middle

That’s is what the next decade looks like.

The lesson above everything:

You don’t just raise capital.
You choose who you’re going to build with.

So my advise is to picture the hardest moment of your next 10 years -
team burnout, a missed quarter, a tough strategic call.

Now imagine that investor sitting across from you.

Do you want them in that room?
Or would they make that moment harder?

That answer is your decision.

How do you vet your investors?","Sergio Gonzalez Gaspar","activity","urn:li:share:7414622167327526912","2025-11-22","Valid 7414622168858185729","ACoAAAVtYaIBzPZvBGyyAt6tU92JQ-GAfEUOlUo","ACwAAAVt","ACwAAAVtYaIBt4kAdFvvjnWSL3Y_4mrj9vTypr8","ACwAAAVt","✅ Record Found","true",,false

They move only when three internal conditions inside the buying organisation are in place.

We call these The Three Gates of Complex Buying:

Gate 1: Recognition
Stakeholders must understand who you are and where you fit. This is supported by research on how people categorise and interpret new information.

Gate 2: Relevance
Stakeholders must see that your solution genuinely fits their world. This is supported by research on similarity, social proof and how people judge applicability.

Gate 3: Safety
Critical roles must feel the decision is acceptable and low risk. This is supported by research on how organisations perceive risk, loss and uncertainty.

When all three gates are open, decisions move.
When even one gate is closed, they freeze, no matter how strong the business case is.

I want to share with you X big lessons I learned as a founder in 2025


1. If your plan requires luck, it's a bad plan.


2. Whenever there is a team disagreement, always choose the option with the 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗱. Typically team disagreements come from someone wanting to do it fast vs someone wanting do to it right. Pick the latter. (always easier said than done)


3. Instead of 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 about someone's behavior. 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 the person about their behavior and what your expectations are.


4. Most founders are just glorified Quality Assurance Managers, but for everything from legal to sales to code.


5. Your company growth is directly proportionate to the number of A players you have in the team. 


6. Your growth problems will be solved by hiring 𝘣𝘦𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳 people. But hiring better people is harder that just hiring 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 people.


7. The best way to 𝘬𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘮𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘶𝘮 is to move in many directions all at once.


8. As a founder you need to buy back as much of your time as you can. You can do this in 3 ways:

By 𝘂𝗽𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 certain services: This year I got a new gym membership 100m from my home. This saves me about 100 hours/year on gym commute alone. 💪 

By 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: this year we have build a solid management structure at Softup, thanks to Flavio, Krisli and Gerald. We have delegated many excecutive responsibilities to them.

Or favorite my way, by 𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 all together: This year we made many small experiements which didn't pan out. It's important to know when to step back and re-prioritise.



9. 𝗜𝘁'𝘀 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝗼𝗻𝗲. Always treat your last customer as your first. Always treat your current employee as your only.



10. 𝗔𝗱𝗱 𝘂𝗿𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆: our default ETA for any routine task was end of week. We changed that to end of day. This is not to add pressure but rather find failure points. And we did found many.

Certain tasks were automated, many were reduced in scope, some tasks were deemed unneccesary, the rest was delivered on time, so 7X faster (with minor exceptions). 



As always thank you for following liking and interacting with me and Softup this year.

Progress doesn’t need louder goals or bigger plans.

It starts with noticing the scripts we’re running on autopilot and choosing differently.

For 2026, I wish you:

- clearer thinking instead of constant urgency
- fewer default reactions, more intentional choices
- growth that feels sustainable, not performative

May next year be less about repeating what’s familiar and more about building what actually fits.

Viele Unternehmen investieren gerade massiv in KI.  
Pilotprojekte laufen, erste Use Cases entstehen.

Doch dann? Passiert oft... nichts.

Der Schritt von „wir haben KI ausprobiert"" zu „KI ist Teil unseres Arbeitsalltags"" – genau hier scheitern die meisten.

Nicht an der Technologie. Sondern am fehlenden Change.

→ Unklare Befähigung der Mitarbeitenden → Keine echte Einbindung der Teams → Arbeitsweisen, die sich nie verändert haben

Darüber sprechen wir – gemeinsam mit Experten, die genau diesen Wandel in Unternehmen begleiten und mitgestalten.

Gestern hatten wir unsere nuwacom-Weihnachtsfeier – für mich ist das auch immer ein Moment zum Innehalten. Dieses Jahr sind wir sehr schnell gewachsen, haben an vielen spannenden Projekten gearbeitet und die Weichen für eine große Zukunft gestellt.

Das gesamte Team kam in Koblenz zusammen. Normalerweise arbeiten wir verteilt über ganz Europa – Belgien, Luxemburg, London, Berlin, München. Unterschiedliche Lebenswege, Kulturen und Perspektiven. Und trotzdem fühlt es sich an, als würden wir jeden Tag im selben Raum sitzen. Dieselbe Motivation. Dieselbe Mission.

Ein Moment hat für mich unseren Teamspirit perfekt eingefangen: die Driving Range auf dem Golfplatz. Regen, Kälte – und trotzdem der gemeinsame Ehrgeiz, den eigenen Abschlag zu verbessern und sich gegenseitig zu pushen. Genau dieses Miteinander, dieser Anspruch, gemeinsam besser zu werden, zeichnet uns als Team aus.

This week’s theme centres on building something meaningful.

Not imposed.
Not demanded.
But created through voluntary contribution.

The vision is clear: build a structure that represents purpose, values and shared responsibility. The starting point is unusual. It begins not with materials or measurements, but with willingness.

Take contributions from those who genuinely want to give.

Great things are not built through obligation alone. They are built when people choose to participate.

Ideas

Before construction begins, there is vision. Clarity of design. Precision of detail. Intentionality in every dimension.

Strong ideas come first. Without them, activity becomes noise.

Courage

Building something that lasts requires discipline.
Standards must be upheld. Details must matter.

Courage is committing to excellence even when compromise would be easier.

Imagination

The real lesson is not about a building. It is about creating an environment where meaning, trust and shared purpose can exist.

Imagination turns materials into significance. It transforms resources into impact.

Leadership is not only about solving problems.
It is about designing spaces where people can thrive.

Ideas define direction.
Courage maintains standards.
Imagination brings vision to life.","Martin Port","activity","urn:li:share:7430341534270525441","2025-11-22","Valid 7430341537424728065","ACoAAAGkJSMBQX5JPEPIE0dN1PHQCFOmn-XH53A","ACwAAAGk","ACwAAAGkJSMBOpuE-ZaCMhoeFpk1UifqyPuKkYw","ACwAAAGk","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Simon is the founder of Depop, the global fashion marketplace that redefined peer-to-peer resale for a new generation. 

He is now Founder and CEO of DELLI, building a curated marketplace that connects independent food makers with a global audience.

We had a fascinating conversation about building platforms, scaling communities, and the realities of taking a vision from zero to global.

What struck me most is how much we have in common.

• Building marketplaces that rely on trust
• Using technology to simplify complexity
• Focusing relentlessly on user experience
• And understanding that community always comes before scale

There’s something about founders who have navigated hyper-growth and come out sharper, clearer, and even more ambitious the second and third time around.

I agree. For established enterprise software businesses, the reality has always been the same: innovate or decline. Private equity can bring capital, focus and operational discipline, but sustained value creation still comes down to product relevance, continuous innovation and customer success.

What has changed is the acceleration driven by AI. The opportunity is enormous, but so is the responsibility. In enterprise environments, the biggest risks remain security, accountability and reliability. These are not abstract concerns. They sit at the core of customer trust.

My view is simple: if AI generates code, a human is still accountable for it. Even if something else has written it, someone must read it, understand it and take responsibility for it. That is not a technical limitation. It is a governance and safety requirement.

Enterprise software buyers still buy from people they trust. Relationships matter. Reputation matters. And accountability matters even more in an AI enabled world.

The businesses that win will be those that combine:
• Continuous innovation
• Rigorous oversight
• Strong customer relationships
• Clear ownership of outcomes

Speed without control creates risk. Control without innovation creates stagnation.

Clear visibility of your market and pipeline determines your growth.

That’s why I use Handshaik across all my businesses.

It is simple to use, fast to deploy and delivers real commercial value from day one.

What I value most:

• Real time visibility of my customer base
• Intelligent prospecting across defined sectors
• Clean company data without endless manual research
• Structured pipeline management
• Clear tracking of relationship status and opportunity stage
• Better internal focus for sales and leadership teams

It removes friction from business development. No scattered spreadsheets. No outdated lists. No guesswork.

For founder led businesses, sales teams and growth focused companies, this is a serious tool. It allows you to move from reactive networking to proactive, data driven expansion.

If you are responsible for revenue, pipeline or market expansion, you should at least see it in action.

Too many skilled operators are buried in admin. Too much revenue is trapped in process.

The real opportunity is simple:

Move the admin to AI.

Put the people on the tools.

When back office hours reduce: 
• Overhead drops
• Capacity increases
• Engineers increase
• Revenue scales
• Profit improves

AI should not create complexity.
AI should fund growth.

At Build Concierge, that is exactly what we do.

We sit on top of your existing systems and automate what consumes hours every day, across calls, booking, follow ups, payments and customer engagement.

It was an incredibly powerful and deeply sobering experience. In all likelihood, it will be the last time we see these buildings as they are the homes that stood for the past two years as silent witnesses to the murders and the hostages taken on October 7th 2023.

Walking through these spaces, seeing the photographs, the names, the remains of ordinary lives destroyed, brings home the scale of the atrocity committed by Hamas. 

These were not symbols or abstractions. These were people. Families. Homes.
We must never forget what happened on October 7th.

And we must also never forget what followed from October 8th onwards the hate marches across Europe and around the world, falsely branded as “pro-Palestinian,” but so often revealing themselves as something far darker: open antisemitism, disconnected from peace, disconnected from humanity, and disconnected from truth.

Memory matters. 

Bearing witness matters. And silence is not an option.

There is a line in every enterprise market where the rules of physics change.

Below the Behavioural Constraint Line, traditional economics apply. Buyers evaluate value, price, and features. If your product is better, you win.

Above the line, the logic inverts. Decisions stop behaving like commercial choices and start behaving like risk decisions.

Above the line:
Value does not convert; Proof converts.

Persuasion fails; Defensibility wins.

The status quo isn't inertia; it's a defensibility strategy.

If you are selling above the line using below-the-line tactics (better demos, ROI calculators, feature comparisons), you aren't selling. You are just educating a market that is structurally unable to buy from you.

Commission President von der Leyen just announced that the EU will introduce low-carbon requirements for public procurement — creating a powerful new incentive for clean industrial production.

The new rules, part of the upcoming Industrial Accelerator Act, would set minimum standards for low-carbon goods in public contracts, starting with sectors like batteries, solar and wind components, EVs, power cables, and charging infrastructure.

Why it matters: Public procurement accounts for roughly 14% of EU GDP. By embedding sustainability criteria into that spending, the EU is turning government purchasing into one of the largest demand signals for green manufacturing on the continent.

What to watch:
1. Steel and cement are strong candidates for early inclusion — sectors where scaling low-carbon production has been held back by cost gaps that demand-side policy can help close.
2. A broader procurement overhaul is expected in late 2026, with a labelling system for low-carbon industrial products starting with steel
Tangible effects will take time, but that also gives businesses a runway to adapt and invest

This is an exciting step toward using public investment as a catalyst for decarbonization and industrial innovation. The challenge now is in the execution — getting the criteria right, keeping timelines ambitious, and ensuring the transition is accessible for businesses of all sizes.","Christopher Engman","activity","urn:li:share:7428701719586492416","2025-11-22","Valid 7428701722660872192","ACoAAAAERXwB1sVqWdvAh5t-4CRcUJ9J5_el81Y","ACwAAAAE","ACwAAAAERXwB8ueOFrLAyfJq0RDTWQzy3LGAb18","ACwAAAAE","✅ Record Found","true",,false

They followed the same three steps to get there.

1. First, they landed smaller initial deals with large companies — getting a foot in the door.

2. Second, they expanded 10 to 100 of those accounts toward the full solution through disciplined deal orchestration. Not by selling harder, but by navigating complex buying centers systematically.

3. Third, they developed new offerings for their top clients and combined organic growth with strategic acquisitions — creating cross-sell momentum that compounds over time.

The pattern is remarkably consistent. The vast majority of B2B Fortune 500 companies generate over 80% of their revenue from fewer than 100 top accounts. A handful of exceptions exist — pharmaceutical distributors like McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health operate with a broader base — but they are exactly that: exceptions.

This pattern is why I wrote the Megadeals book. And it's why we founded Njord — the deal orchestration platform built to help companies execute steps two and three, where the real value is created and where most organisations struggle the most.

In complex enterprise deals, we assume that if the ROI is strong enough, the deal will close. But the thinking on ""Decidable Growth"" by Jonas Lind at Njord highlights a critical flaw in that logic.

It introduces the concept of Risk-Bearing Roles.

These are the specific individuals—in Legal, Security, Finance, Operations—who have to sign off on your deal. And for them, the math is different. They face Asymmetric Downside.

-> If the deal succeeds: The credit is shared. The organization moves on. 
-> If the deal fails: The blame is personal. It hits their credibility, their internal trust, and their career.

Under these conditions, it is rational for them to stop optimizing for value and start optimizing for defensibility.

They aren't asking: ""Is this the best solution?"" They are asking: ""Will this still look reasonable when an auditor asks me why I signed?""

If your champion loves the product, but the CFO or CISO can't find a ""defensible position"" to protect themselves against future scrutiny, they won't say no. They will just issue a ""soft veto"":

""I cannot recommend this. If you decide to go ahead, it will be your decision.""

And just like that, the deal dies.

The takeaway: In complexity 5 and 6 deals, you aren't selling upside. You are providing the safety required for a Risk-Bearing Role to say ""yes"" without risking their career.

Risk bearing roles is one of the reasons why the marketing and sales playbook for complexity 5 and 6 is different. Multithreaded, not following a sequential sales process and with other messaging.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424775389790527488","Yes","One of the most consistent patterns we see is how win rates improve once companies begin using the Njord Deal Orchestration. 

The shift comes from giving stakeholders a clearer, more structured decision environment.

Njord starts by mapping the full stakeholder group, including the hidden influencers who shape how decisions move internally. This clarity allows teams to communicate more consistently and reduce the friction that often comes from misalignment or missed stakeholders.

With the stakeholder environment understood, the Njord solution creates coordinated visibility across all relevant individuals through multi-platform exposure (News sites, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn). When everyone involved encounters the same narrative, familiarity increases and internal traction strengthens. Buyers move with more confidence because information is consistent and reinforced across channels.

The result is a smoother experience for every stakeholder.
Confusion drops, decision paths become clearer, and organisations feel more certain about moving forward long before final discussions begin.

A better win rate is not created at the end of the funnel.
It is created by bringing clarity, consistency, and confidence to every part of the decision environment.

What are the key problems you wish all relevant stakeholders had as a top priority?
What top 5-10 insights do you wish they knew?
What references from exactly the same industry would you want them to know you work with already?

The talent is here. The innovation is here. The momentum is here.  
Talked on Dagens industri  TV and for the Nordic Scaleup awards about what needs to be done if Europe wants to fuel the growth and catch up with US and China’s growth: 
	•	A structurally smaller and more fragmented capital market - European VC is ~0.3% of GDP, less than one third of the US level, and growth-stage pools are significantly thinner.
	•	A growing brain drain and scale-up leakage – nearly 30% of European unicorns have relocated outside the EU, and only ~8% of global scaleups are based here.
	•	A market paradox – the EU has about 450M people vs ~340M in the US, but founders still face 27 regulatory regimes instead of one unified market. 
	•	A short-term mindset while China plans on 10- and 50-year horizons backed by industrial policy. 
	•	EU Pension funds allocating just 0.02% to venture capital, compared with almost 2% for US pension funds - meaning Europeans miss out on both innovation and long-term upside. 
	•	Nearly €11 trillion sitting in cash and deposits in the EU – savings that could instead be channelled into new companies and growth if we unlock the right vehicles and incentives.  
If we close these gaps, we won’t just create more unicorns, we’ll build an ecosystem that can genuinely compete at global scale and write Europe’s next chapter of growth.

We are on it and are putting the focus on companies that can fuel this growth. 💪","Susanne Najafi","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7422305076515348480","2025-11-22","Valid 7422305076515348480","ACoAAAAJkBoBVu6uV8w1a3Bp7IROelkwztt5rFU","ACwAAAAJ","ACwAAAAERXwB8ueOFrLAyfJq0RDTWQzy3LGAb18","ACwAAAAE","✅ Record Found","true","Response",true

457 Wellington St W, Toronto, ON M5V 1E7, Canada.

Executive Breakfast about high complexity deal orchestration.

Mark Organ and I run this executive breakfast.

Topics:
1. Why Enterprise Sales Is Breaking at Scale
Context-setting research, why hiring more sellers fails. Rainmaker dependency and market complexity.

2. How Large Organizations Actually Buy Innovation
Decision-making dynamics in complex organizations. W-model consensus formation, brand & perceived safety.

3. Scaling Rainmakers (Not Duplicating Them)
Two scaling models and why traditional approaches fail. Multiplying impact through systems, AI, and org design.

4. Deal Orchestration: The New Operating Layer
Stakeholder intelligence, media orchestration, executive authority. Examples of accelerated access, velocity, deal quality.

5. 2026 Roadmap for Enterprise Sales Leaders
Where AI fits — and where it doesn't — in complex deals. Simplifying, stopping, replacing ineffective practices.

Who is it for: C-level executives (CEO, CRO, CSO, Chief Commercial Officer) in enterprise-focused companies.

Who is it not for: Mid-level leaders, junior managers, or companies selling to the SMB market.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7421869565950963713","Yes","Why do sales people that claim that their key skill is relationship building less successful in B2B deal complexity 5 and 6?

In high-complexity B2B (often referred to as Complexity Level 5 & 6, involving large buying committees, consensus decision-making, and high strategic risk), ""Relationship Builders"" are statistically the least likely to be high performers.

Here is why relying on ""Relationship Building"" fails when complexity spikes:
1. They manage tension incorrectly (The ""Friend Zone"" Trap)
The Problem: Relationship builders prioritize reducing tension. They want the customer to feel comfortable and happy. They acquiesce to requests to keep the peace.

Why it fails in Complexity 5/6: To get a large organization to change its behavior (buy your solution), you need to create tension, not reduce it. You have to challenge their current thinking and show them that their status quo is dangerous. Relationship builders are often afraid to say ""You are wrong"" because they fear damaging the rapport, so the deal stalls in a state of ""polite inaction.""

2. They build bridges with the wrong people
The Problem: Relationship builders naturally gravitate toward people who are accessible, friendly, and have time to talk.

Why it fails in Complexity 5/6: In large enterprises, the people with time to chat are rarely the decision-makers. They are often ""Talkers,"" not ""Mobilizers."" The Relationship Builder spends months having coffee with a manager who has no budget authority, thinking they are ""working the account,"" while the real decision is being made in a closed-door C-suite meeting they weren't invited to.

3. They confuse ""Support"" with ""Value""
The Problem: When a client asks for something, the Relationship Builder says, ""I'll get that for you right away!"" They act as a concierge.

Why it fails in Complexity 5/6: In complex sales, customers don't need a servant; they need a teacher. High-level executives (the C-Suite) don't buy from people who are just ""helpful""; they buy from people who offer commercial insight that helps them compete better. If your value proposition is ""I am responsive and nice,"" you are a commodity.

4. They cannot navigate Consensus Conflict
The Problem: In a committee of 6–10 stakeholders (Finance, Tech, User, Legal), there is always internal conflict. The CFO wants to cut costs; the CTO wants the best tech.

In high-complexity sales (Level 5–6), people buy from people who challenge and educate them on how to survive.

The Rainmaker wins because they build relationships based on respect and value, not just likability. They teach the client something new, tailor the message for resonance, and take control of the commercial conversation.

The power system is under increasing strain. Variable generation, growing congestion and higher volatility mean that flexibility has become core infrastructure, not a marginal add-on.

That is why the direction taken by Svenska Kraftnät is important. By proposing a separate customer category for energy storage in the future transmission tariff, storage is finally being recognised for what it is: either consumption nor generation, but a system function in its own right.

Treating storage as both load and generation creates distorted cost signals and unnecessary regulatory risk. A dedicated category allows the grid value of storage - balancing, congestion relief and system stability - to be priced correctly.

This is not about subsidies.
It is about accurate system economics.

When flexibility is priced properly, long-duration energy storage becomes investable, scalable and bankable, exactly what the power system needs as it transitions from energy scarcity to system scarcity.

Mine Storage welcomes the new proposition and hopes to contribute to this category in the future.",,"activity","urn:li:share:7415327654351896576","2025-11-22","Valid 7415327655232970752",,"","ACwAAAAERXwB8ueOFrLAyfJq0RDTWQzy3LGAb18","ACwAAAAE","✅ Record Found","true","Response",true

Grown under open skies. Wind, rain, heat, cold.

Every apple you pick has been through something.

That’s what I like about orchards. You see resilience in its purest form. But let’s be honest — resilience doesn’t mean simplicity.

Temperature swings. Soil moisture fluctuations. Disease pressure building quietly in the background. Small changes can have a big impact on quality and yield.

And you can’t manage what you don’t see.

That’s why more growers are turning to sensing technologies. Not because tradition isn’t enough — but because experience combined with real-time data is powerful. When you understand what your trees are actually going through, you can act before stress turns into loss.

Tradition meets data. Nature meets insight.

In this video you see the apple variety Boskoop at a grower's side in the North of Germany. Belle de Boskoop - so the full name - is a vigorous, traditional apple variety known for its firm flesh, high acidity, and excellent suitability for baking and cider. It thrives particularly well in cooler climates.

Did you know: Our sensor portfolio also includes a multi-depth soil sensor to measure EC, soil moisture and soil temperature - even at multiple depths. Perfect (not only) for commercial apple cultivation.

Let's give an example for a potential grower's setup as below, with public numbers available, as you can find on Chat GPT etc.:
- 2 ha heated greenhouse
- Mixed growth of vine tomatoes and cherry/cocktail tomatoes
- Efficient operation with around 71 kg yield per m2
- Around 1.400.000 kg of harvest per year
- Receives an average producer price of 1.20 Euro per kg
- Targeted yearly revenue of 1.700.000 Euro

Let's do some conservative 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 and feedback from out-of-the-box and efficiency driven growers in my network, willing to share, who try out new things for ""growth hacking"":
- Use of music should give a 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗺 𝘆𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝟬.𝟱%
- That leads in this scenario of 2 ha to 8.500 Euro extra revenue
- An efficient grower's margin of 15% leads herby to 1.275 Euro profit
- Electricity for the music will not be more than 1.000 Euro per year

Of course, keeping herby the fact in mind that the multitude of crucial parameters like climate, irrigation, light and plant material etc. will have a far bigger impact in the yield. And there fluctuations will also make it very hard to measure in impact of smaller factors. But that should not stop growers from also leveraging potential smaller parameters/factors like music. The sum of smaller innovations will pay off financially. 𝑺𝒐 𝑰 𝒔𝒂𝒚: 𝒀𝒆𝒔 𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝒎𝒖𝒔𝒊𝒄!

They allow growers to extend seasons, stabilize yields, and move closer to controlled environment agriculture (CEA).

But this shift also brings new challenges:
As more producers ramp up CEA-like systems - like this raspberry setup with massive 300 meter tunnels in the south of Germany getting ready for the upcoming season and planting -, competition intensifies. Higher capital investments, tighter margins, faster cycles, and pressure to differentiate on quality, efficiency, or sustainability are becoming the new normal.

But today, I want to highlight a different group of people: the ones who make the fair possible in the first place.

Behind every stand, every light that turns on in the morning, every smooth registration process, every last-minute problem solved — there is a workforce operating quietly in the background.

This sequence shows a flower field on a late August in the South of Germany. And yes, you are allowed to enter it, you are officially invited to!

Across Germany, you’ll find something quietly remarkable: flower fields where anyone can walk in, cut their own bouquet (Selbstschneiden), and pay—often by dropping cash into a simple box. No cashier. No cameras. Just trust.

At first glance, this feels naïve in a world obsessed with control and monitoring. But these fields work. Season after season.

Why? Because trust changes behavior. When people are treated as honest, many choose to act that way. The absence of friction creates a positive social contract: this is ours to take care of. Farmers reduce overhead, customers enjoy autonomy, and the community reinforces shared norms.

Of course, trust-based models aren’t about ignoring risk—they’re about designing for responsibility instead of suspicion. Clear pricing, social visibility, and local embeddedness all play a role. But the core insight is powerful: not every problem needs a gatekeeper.

In times when businesses default to complexity, the Selbstschneiden fields remind us that simplicity plus trust can be a competitive advantage. Sometimes, the most resilient systems are the ones that assume the best in people—and let them prove it. 🌻

And also from a business perspective quiet simple: Choose the right flowers, who match with the soil and climate - e.g. monitored by hexafarms sensors (and shown at IPM ESSEN next week) -, plant the flower bulbs, occasionally water them and voilà. 🌷","Felix Kirschstein","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7420143127493070849","2025-11-22","Valid 7420143127493070849","ACoAABB9qxwBTUxcBYM1vltLFkryoktWgsE9zcE","ACwAABB9","ACwAABB9qxwBeI50BkG65bHTsbP4YyQsbhZQHGU","ACwAABB9","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Through efficient growing technology, modern irrigation systems, and integrated pest management, production there is conducted at a high level. Several producers are even more technologically advanced than some growers in Central Europe.

I have seen and tasted that first hand as I have been to Almería several times now.

Of course, there are challenges: plastic waste still needs to be reduced further, and there is clear room for improvement when it comes to working conditions.

This perspective from Pieter Waasdorp captures a broader shift we’re seeing across circular retail: as recommerce, repairs and multi-life models scale, complexity grows and dedicated systems become essential.
 
Moving from pilots to real operations requires software built to orchestrate circularity end to end, with AI supporting decisions across products, flows and operations.

👉🏻Manual processes, spreadsheets or isolated tools may work for pilots, but they will never enable true scale.

In just 5 years, the proportion of people who didn’t take advantage of a good business opportunity because they were scared of failure has increased to 49%. The belief that others demand perfection from us has risen 32% since 1989. 

We’ve all felt the pressure to be perfect, whether it’s for ourselves or others. I think it might be holding us back from taking the risks that give us our biggest wins.

Moving countries 9 times, I grew up with failure often being a necessity of success. You have to try over and over before you manage to rebuild your whole life. 

I found that if you experiment enough, you get to the best answer and win. 

At a startup like Tracelight, you can’t afford not to experiment. We tried 5 different acquisition channels before we found the 2 that worked. When you’re up against companies worth over $300b, never settling until you find the best way is often the only way to succeed.

Something I’ve noticed in the startup world is the people who are winning big aren't the ones who stopped failing. They're the ones who stopped letting fear of failure drive their decisions. They focus less on perfection, and more on winning.

In a world where more people are afraid to take risks, there’s opportunity for those who will. Doesn’t mean we should always take crazy risks - sometimes the safe way is the best bet.

But there is a change in mindset I noticed when I entered the startup world - from ""what if I fail?"" to ""how do I find the best answer?"".

It’s having a team and a mission that inspires you. Once you have that, you stop wanting to sleep, and start wanting to do everything you can to build the future.

At 1am, our Head of Sales Ammar H. sent a message in Slack (screenshot below). He said he couldn’t sleep either - and was unbelievably excited about what we were doing.

When you have a team with a shared vision, who are all thrilled beyond measure to build a massive company, everything becomes possible. Yesterday:

João Conrad stays late in the office helping me build a website case study / ads system

Aleksander Misztal reviews at 10pm while building a new feature in Tracelight.

Janek Zimoch gives feedback on case studies at almost midnight the same evening.

Ammar and I brainstorm ideas at 1am

When you have a team like that, you can win anything. It’s why we’ve expanded offices 3 times in 6 months, and are now leading our space.

To be clear, this isn’t about embracing extremes of hustle culture, a 9-9-6 schedule, or reducing your personality to work (I somehow find time to do other things, don’t worry), it’s about finding something that makes your work so exciting it feels like a fun sport you can play forever.

If you’re the kind of person that thinks they can find something like that, you might want to check out a startup like Tracelight - we're (always) hiring.","Jeremi Orlowski","activity","urn:li:share:7424410133151236097","2025-11-22","Valid 7424410134740647936","ACoAADa1CXkBDpRhwnW7mD_TeBnSC3213pg5Jtk","ACwAADa1","ACwAADa1CXkB0OXMcoOd62Otycz2D6FDQ-4FQT0","ACwAADa1","✅ Record Found","true",,false

There is a once-in-a-generation change underway in these industries. Every firm knows AI is real now, and everyone is buying.

Realistically, a small number of companies will win. A handful of people within those companies will be responsible for building the AI products that power the next generation of this entire sector.

As part of Tracelight’s technical GTM team, you would be one of the select group of people.

You will:
- Work with our customers to figure out which problems Tracelight should tackle next, and how
- Work alongside our amazing engineers to design and test those new features
- Figure out how our customers get value from Tracelight within their first minute using the product, so they see the power of AI, and change how they work
- Build our customers’ workflows into Tracelight, so AI works specifically for them
- Onboard our customers, train them, and do whatever it takes to make Tracelight useful to them

Technical GTM is an emerging role in our industry. High-achieving ex-IB and consulting people with great client hands and the ability to solve problems from first principles will be exceptionally good at it.

This is the story of how it happened, and a few of the secrets to our success.

We gave back to our community on launch with a one-time Pro access offer, turning them into our biggest public champions. 

This contributed to 30% growth in our Pro tier within a matter of days. If you have thousands of users, activating their goodwill can be enormously impactful. You just need to get their attention and give them a reason to show up for you - whether that's token credits, beta access, or a genuine thank you. 

There’s nothing worse than a viral launch moment with a leaky conversion funnel.

The week before, our incredible growth advisor James McAulay, our amazing Engineering team Aleksander Misztal João Conrad and I obsessively made dozens of small improvements to our website and funnel analytics.

Animated CTA buttons in a floating navigation bar, a Vision Statement, adding the launch video to our landing page, setting up conversion funnels in PostHog integrated with our product, and countless others. 

Together, these changes increased our conversion by 2x, making the launch itself around twice as effective.

Load your script with every psychological tool in your arsenal

One powerful example in our launch video is that our CEO Peter Fuller starts with - “What if you could reach a completely new level of performance in Excel”, and ends with “You can get Tracelight”. 

Asking people a question about their attitude towards a positive target action massively increases the likelihood they follow through. One study by Prof. Greenwald at the University of Washington found that asking voters about voting a few weeks before an election increased turnout by over 25%!

- Analyst workflows will change more this year than any year since the 1980s

- You are going to get AI tools that actually work; you will notice your jobs becoming higher-leverage

- There's going to be a lot more insight in Proposal documents. If you're not using AI to do a strong 'first pass' at the client's problem in the proposal phase, you will find yourself losing bids and market share. (For example, our customers often use Tracelight to comb through client-provided financials and generate deep insights at the proposal phase.)

- You will hear more about new business models. Consultancies and banks are using their internal knowledge to build AI-powered workflows that their clients can initiate whenever they want; this will of course lead to follow-up human advisory fees. Big moment for retention and scalability for the winners here. (It will take a while for this type of revenue to become truly significant.)

- Some private market funds will figure out how to compress deal timelines to a scary extent; they will win a lot of deals. The pace will be superhuman and they will need advisors who can match that. They will pay well for that.

Same structure, same fonts, same charts. More than that - the whole M&A process seems to be frozen in time. For decades now, it’s been a CIM, a financial model, the same valuation methodologies, etc

The easy take is to say bankers are just ""stuck in their ways"".

But I don’t think that’s it. Investment bankers are some of the sharpest and most competitive people in the world. If there was a better way to win a mandate or close a deal, they would have found it.

The reality is that for a long time, the cost of innovation was simply too high. The risk of breaking a proven process with a new tool or approach was not worth it. The safest bet was the best bet.

But that risk calculation is changing.

The cost of experimentation is in free-fall. Products like NotebookLM or Lovable transform static presentations into interactive experiences in minutes. The classic CIM is looking more and more dated by the day.

And increasingly, AI is handling the grunt-work that used to fill analyst’s time. Tracelight users are taking core modelling workflows, like cleaning and presenting management financials in a professional format, and performing them with two keystrokes.

In my opinion the standard playbook is no longer the best bet. There is alpha on the table for the firms ready to change their process.

Some fun facts about our new Brazilian colleague:

- When he was 9, he started his own YouTube channel, and then sold video intros to other YouTubers for £3 each. At 12, he was modding Minecraft - writing a mod to add a banana to the game 🍌 

- As a teenager, he spent years trying to go pro in Counterstrike, training 12 hours a day (1pm to 1am). He worked software engineering jobs during the day and trained at night. ""I would code in the pause between games""

- Still as a teenager, he built his own design agency by reaching out to Twitter design influencers, eventually working with one and building his own following (I'll drop his Twitter in comments)

- He was chatting to one of the godfathers of open-source development (not at liberty to disclose the name 🤫), who told him to move to London and work for Tracelight

We got his visa sorted and we couldn't be happier that he is with us full-time.

Joao designs, builds front-end, hustles, and is great vibes. A few days before flying from Brazil, he asked in Slack ""how big are your feet?""...of course on Day 1 he turns up with a pair of Havaianas for everyone in the team.

For 4 life-changing years I lived in sun-drenched California. I was infected with the manic creativity of Hollywood and the relentless drive of the LA-SF tech scene, and made lifelong friendships that shaped who I am today. After many wild adventures, I knew what I wanted next:

To join the defining technological revolution of our time: I wanted to work at an AI startup.

Europe has its problems - and London in particular. It’s wet and cold 9 months a year. I’m an avid surfer - no waves or pretty beaches in London, that’s for sure. Some people even told me it was dangerous and miserable. 

I decided to move anyway. Mostly on a strange feeling, a gravitational pull towards the city I grew up in. My peers in the US were landing prestigious MBB offers and jumping into launch pads at YC’s hottest startups.

By comparison, my move back to Europe seemed a ridiculous gamble at best, career suicide at worst.

What kind of things did I hear when I announced I was moving to London? 
“All the opportunity is in the US”
“there’s no startup ecosystem in Europe”
“you’re wasting your chance”.

The moment I moved to London and met Peter Fuller, Aleksander Misztal, and Janek Zimoch, I realised that the doom and gloom around Europe’s startup scene couldn’t be further from the truth.

There is a thriving startup ecosystem in Europe. Countless startups like Lovable, ElevenLabs, 16 new Unicorns, and my home, Tracelight, are pushing the boundaries of AI. If you’re driven to entrepreneurship and tech, there’s a ton of opportunity. Some say if you build in Europe you can’t scale the US market. Our biggest clients are in the US. I joined as the 5th employee 4 months ago. We’ve since expanded offices twice and are at 12.

In terms of lifestyle, London is the best place I’ve ever lived - cozy pubs, lovely people, amazing music on every corner (thanks Fred again!), and pretty streets buzzing with cafés and activity.

California is fantastic. Don’t let the world convince you it’s the only place you can build something meaningful.

""Deals are like babies. There's one born every minute, but each one is a miracle.""

Why are they a miracle? Because a million things have to go right to close a deal. You have to work ferociously hard to get one over the line.

Many AI companies are selling bankers and investors a false dream. Use their products so you don't have to work hard anymore. ""Prompt an LLM so you can go home at 8pm.""

I'm not going to tell you that. I don't believe it. Tracelight's customers work in viciously competitive industries, and they are the type of people who push themselves to the absolute limit. I respect them for that.

A huge thank you to our customers, partners, and everyone who has supported us along the way.

Bringing a medical device to market is one of the most complex challenges in healthcare. Teams must navigate thousands of pages of regulatory documentation, interpret evolving MDR requirements, coordinate with Notified Bodies, and do all of this under extreme time pressure and uncertainty.

At CertHub, we’re on a mission to remove regulatory bottlenecks from MedTech innovation. By providing compliance companions for both manufacturers and Notified Bodies we turn regulatory complexity into a clear, efficient, and predictable process, so life-saving products reach patients faster.

Grateful, energized, and just getting started. Back to building! 🚀

But Mannheim? This was different. Deep conversations. Actual solutions discussed. And we had a lot of fun... 🍿 

Luca Luca Salvatore and I are back from the Infomarkt der Möglichkeiten for QM/RA with valuable insights and substantive talks with manufacturers looking to bringing their QM & RA to the next level. 

Manufacturers ask the right questions: What concrete problem does a solution actually solve? How is data structured so it's usable in daily work?  And crucially: What's the concrete value and ROI not just a list of features?

Is there one solution for everything? Of course not. CertHub focuses on the sweet-spot where AI-supported Technical Documentation and QMS combined with a strong Audit support can deliver real impact without feeling like an ""extra project.""

Thank you to MedicalMountains GmbH (Aidana Ghebreyohanes and Melanie Gebel) and CUBEX NEXT MANNHEIM CI for outstanding organization and to all partners and manufacturers. We're already looking forward to returning to Mannheim soon.

Clarity over complexity. That's our focus.

In a world where convenience is the #1 driver of purchase, forcing a patient or a customer to travel for a measurement is a barrier to entry.
In 2026, the leaders in Orthopedics and Custom Retail will be those who reach their customers anywhere.

With our mobile scanning SDK, your clients are currently :
✅ Launching remote monitoring for home-based patients. 
✅ Empowering retail partners to sell custom-fit without being experts. 
✅ Scaling internationally without opening a single new clinic.

Don't wait for the customer to come to you. Give them the power to start the journey from their living room, or their local store, with the same precision you’d provide in your headquarter.

❌ A wasted product (and margin). 
❌ Hours of rework to fix it.

In 2026, relying solely on manual skill for precision is a business risk you can no longer afford.

At MyFit Solutions, we didn't just build a ""scanner."" We built a guided experience. By transforming a smartphone into a medical-grade tool, we allow your teams to focus on their expertise, while the technology handles the precision.

For police forces, the manual burden of redacting footage is more than just a compliance headache - it’s an operational bottleneck that keeps officers away from frontline work.

In this piece, I explore how, at PIMLOC, we're helping forces change the workflow: moving from manual review to an automated, privacy-first model where intelligence and data protection happen in parallel. It’s about being future-ready, not just catching up.

There was some critical discussion about the responsible deployment of AI in policing, and what was needed to unlock its safe use for the benefits of us all.  It was great to sit alongside the new Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner Prof. William Webster, Dylan Alldridge from National Police Chiefs'​ Council, Dr. Mackenzie J. from PROBabLE Futures, Lara Groves from Ada Lovelace Institute and Ellen Lefley from JUSTICE and (thank you for the invitation!).

The report focuses on what must be in place for AI in policing to be trustworthy, value for money, support policing goals, and comply with human rights and the fair administration of justice.

This report identified five specific learnings, all which chime with how we think about AI at PIMLOC:
1️⃣ Fitness for Purpose – AI tools must work, and must work for the context in which they are used.
2️⃣ Competent, Ethical and Lawful Use – Human oversight must be real, informed and supported.
3️⃣ Understanding Impacts – AI tools must be evaluated both before and after deployment.
4️⃣ Proportionate and Effective Safeguards – Clear limits, accountability routes and effective redress are essential.
5️⃣ Public Participation – Trust requires visibility, involvement and accountability.
Its a well researched and written report. 

I recommend anyone interested in AI for policing give it a read! Link in comments below  (The ecosystem diagram on page 45 is a personal favourite, great work Ellen Lefley and team 👍 )

We could have talked for hours today at TECHARENA. Europe is about to deploy €410 billion to increase our competitiveness. It is a massive amount of money, but what we really need is innovation combined with speed and action.

It was a great discussion:
•	Arba Kokalari  (Member of the European Parliament )
•	Vahid Zohali (CEO at IBM Sweden)
•	Jens Holtinger (CTO at Volvo Group)
•	Emma Wikberger (Teknikföretagen ) thank you for moderating!

I also want to give a special shout-out to KTH Innovation and Lisa Ericsson. They were instrumental in bridging our years of research to the market. Policy makers should listen to them. With IPercept, we will multiply this support through the impact we make.

I decided to move to Sweden and build here for a reason. It is a great place to invent things, but more than that, there are so many of us who want to prove the world that the Swedish model of openness, working together and long-term thinking actually wins.","Karoly Szipka","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7427979760544251904","2025-11-22","Valid 7427979760544251904","ACoAABIJcE0BBmSTGquTk9c5NymQeeHOP_iaJSQ","ACwAABIJ","ACwAABIJcE0Bv6LV2YQ3YIpYbhkL1w7qDOabefw","ACwAABIJ","✅ Record Found","true",,false

The monitoring approaches of the past work well for simple rotating equipment. But CNC machines are far more complex. To truly understand what’s happening inside them, we had to develop a completely new approach.

Join Lilian Dávila, our Head of Analytics, and me for a 30-minute webinar to see how we unlocked a stream of data and facts for every CNC machine, regardless of brand, age, or controller, to change the status quo.

At IPercept, we aim to make every customer feel that WOW experience. One of the most powerful ways we do this is through our “Library of WOW”, a collection of machine components sent to us by customers after our system has flagged them for failure.

Imagine being an expert who has worked with CNC machines for over 40 years, and for the first time seeing a technology pinpoint a defect with such precision before a breakdown occurs. Often, they only truly believe the digital insight once they disassemble the machine and analyze the proof in their hands. And sometimes, they even send the component to us as a gift.

This customer “WOW” is the biggest boost for us at IPercept . It’s an enormous inspiration to witness how what we are building grows and helps change an entire industry.

Letztes Jahr ist bei uns zu Hause mehrfach die Heizung ausgefallen.
Eine Buderus Logano, eigentlich ein solides Gerät. Ursache: Die Brennsteuerung war defekt.

Das größere Problem: Der Hersteller hatte die Ersatzteilversorgung bereits 2021 eingestellt. Die Optionen waren ernüchternd:

👉 Neu kaufen.
👉 Oder irgendwo selbst ein Ersatzteil auftreiben.

Wir haben schließlich über Kleinanzeigen ein gebrauchtes Teil gefunden – teuer, mit Risiko, aber alternativlos.

Kurzfristig und alles stressig. Kalte Kinderzimmer, Elektroradiatoren im Baumarkt geholt und einiges an Recherche. Haben uns da irgendwie durchgehangelt.

Was mich im Nachhinein am meisten ärgert ist nicht der Defekt. 
Sondern dass ich es nicht kommen sehen konnte. 

Eigentlich wäre eine Wärmepumpe mein Ziel gewesen. Aber Haus und Substanz erfüllen dafür aktuell noch nicht die Voraussetzungen.

Auch diese Transformation braucht Vorbereitung – nicht nur eine gute Idee.
Die Entscheidung war also nicht strategisch, eher erzwungen.

Genau dieses Muster sehe ich in der Industrie immer wieder – bei Instandhaltern und Werksverantwortlichen:

• Komponenten altern schleichend
• Kritische Zustände bleiben unsichtbar
• OEMs stellen Ersatzteile ein (Obsoleszenz)
• Beschaffung wird teuer, langsam oder riskant
• Betrieb improvisiert mit Workarounds
• Investitionen entstehen unter Druck und nicht aus der Planung heraus

🔥 Wenn du den realen Zustand deiner Assets nicht kennst, steuerst du nicht. Du reagierst. Und Reaktion ist fast immer teurer als Vorbereitung.

Ob Heizkeller oder CNC-Fertigung: Transparenz über den technischen Zustand entscheidet darüber, ob du gestalten kannst oder permanent Feuer löscht. 

Nicht die Störung ist das Problem.
Sondern die fehlende Vorwarnung.

When a giant like Hexagon makes such a move, it sends a strong signal: the “fix it when it breaks” era is officially dead. For decades, quality was about measuring the part. The leaders in manufacturing are now shifting the focus to measuring the machine itself.​

At IPercept, we have always believed that the missing piece is a data layer for complex industrial machines that is 10x simpler to deploy and delivers 10x more actionable granularity than any other approach. This is the only credible path to leading and defining the industrial machine intelligence category.​

It’s exciting to see the market heating up. The race to zero unplanned downtime is on!

Ford’s CEO recently revealed they have 5,000 mechanic jobs open, each paying around $120,000/year. And still, they can’t find people to fill them. That’s $600M in waiting investment from Ford alone.

The message is clear: we’ve neglected manufacturing skills for far too long. And now, demand for skilled technicians has exploded.

At IPercept, we see this every day.
The only way to close the gap is to deploy technology that empowers people, making complex machines simple, data accessible, and intuitive to work with.

It’s time to reboot the narrative around choosing manufacturing as a career. People on the factory floor are essential. High-impact. And the field is full of opportunity.

Manufacturing is hard, but the value unlocked is enormous.

The data below makes it obvious:
Manufacturing is still the least scaled function for AI. Only 5% of AI high performers have fully scaled AI in manufacturing, yet it’s also the function delivering the strongest ROI.

This gap isn’t surprising.
Factories run on physical machines that are multi-vendor, old, and closed. The real bottleneck has never been the algorithms, it’s the lack of reliable, high-quality machine signals.

And this is also the reason why manufacturing holds the largest upside:
- Major increases in uptime
- Higher and more consistent product quality
- Dramatic reductions in waste and energy use
- Stronger competitiveness and supply-chain resilience

Whoever brings reliable, machine-level AI into factories will unlock a global industrial transformation.

Hier sind die 5 Office-Trends, die in modernen Startups nicht mehr wegzudenken sind:

1️⃣ Silent Zones Rückzugsorte für Fokus, Deep Work und Konzentration. Besonders wichtig in offenen Büroflächen. (Telefonboxen + Akustiklösungen sind hier Gold wert.)

2️⃣ Creator Spaces Räume für Content, Ideenentwicklung, Workshops oder schnelle Team-Alignments. Startups brauchen flexible Flächen, die kreativ machen und nicht bremsen.

3️⃣ Modulare Möbel Nichts ist so konstant wie der Wandel. Modulare Tische, mobile Trennwände oder flexible Meeting-Situationen ermöglichen schnelle Raumveränderungen ohne Umbau.

4️⃣ Better Acoustics Akustik ist ein Game-Changer. Weniger Lärm = weniger Stress, bessere Zusammenarbeit und höhere Produktivität. Viele Teams unterschätzen diesen Hebel noch.

5️⃣ Social & Community Areas Weil Kultur nicht im Zoom-Call entsteht. Bereiche, in denen Austausch, spontanes Networking und Teammomente passieren, werden 2025 noch wichtiger.

👉 Workspace ist heute ein strategischer Wettbewerbsvorteil. Wer den Raum an die Arbeitsweise anpasst – statt umgekehrt – gewinnt Fokus, Kreativität und Teamenergie.

Wenn du glaubst, dein Stil sei schon „gut genug“ und hörst auf, ihn zu hinterfragen.

10 Jahre B2B Sales.
Unzählige Gespräche.
Ein eigenes Buch über Sales Skills geschrieben.

Menschlich.
Ich nehme jedes Gespräch auf.
Schau sie mir an.
Lass die KI drüberlaufen.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427271014025256960","No","Every sales organisation needs to have a Sales Playbook in place. 

It keeps the sales organisation aligned, helps reps become better at their craft, and handle every single objection with grace. 

Most decent VCs request it in the due diligence. 

The challenge for sales leaders: 

Compile that Playbook and keep it up to date. Constantly. 

New objections come up in sales calls, which need to be added and taught to the reps.

What makes that task of updating the playbook even harder: 

No reps is every going to consume it. 

It is just too boring and dull of a resource. 

Together with Gerald Zankl from Kickscale FlexCo, I am going to show next Tuesday, 17th February at 12:00-12:45 how that whole process can be automated:

👉 How we capture objections in calls automatically.

👉 How good answers to objections look like.

👉 How these are added automatically to a playbook. 

👉 Then approved by Sales leaders.

👉 And taught to reps through slack. On the job. With AI. 

I assume that this will be the revival of (AI-first) Sales playbooks. 

One that benefits the CEOs, Sales Leaders and reps alike.

That's how many ""uhms"", ""ehms"" I say in an average sales call.

Every 17 seconds.

And each one costs me money. 😮‍💨

here's the brutal truth after analyzing all my sales calls from last year:

My 3 most expensive filler words:

1. ""Uhm"" when stating price
- showed that I wasn't sure and people were 28% more likely to ask for a discount

2. ""Like"" during objection handling
- this one hurts my credibility according to our AI

3. ""Ehmm, so..."" I did that often before closing
- showed a lack of confidence

So I asked my co-founder & sales genius Gerald Zankl what I could do about it...

he told me the same as our AI did.

The simplest method:

Speak 15% slower.

That's it.

No coaching. No course. Just: Slower speech.

which helped me to get:

- from 157 to 44 filler words
- From 23% to 31% close rate

I hope you guys are better than me. :)

On February 17, Patrick Trümpi and I show you each one, with data.

Most sales teams still guess why deals fail.

Old-school objection handling is everywhere:
– Generic training
– Fake role plays
– Hoping you picked the right objections

But your sales calls hold the truth.

We dug into thousands of real conversations at Kickscale FlexCo and Taskbase.
The patterns are loud and clear.

Here’s what you get in our live session:
✅ The 5 objections killing most deals (backed by call data)
✅ How to let AI surface your top objections on autopilot
✅ Language that turns “no” into “let’s talk”
✅ A playbook that updates itself after every call
✅ Coaching that actually changes behavior

No theory.
No guessing.
Only real data from real teams.

Most sales teams handle objections the same way they did 10 years ago:

❌ Generic ""handling objection"" training
❌ Role plays based on made-up scenarios
❌ Guessing which objections matter most

Meanwhile, your actual calls are screaming the answers at you.

Patrick Trümpi (Co-Founder/CRO Taskbase) and Gerald Zankl (Co-Founder/CEO Kickscale FlexCo) analyzed thousands of real sales conversations to find the patterns that separate deals won from deals lost.

Früher war die Hürde zwischen einer Idee und der Realität oft das fehlende Wissen, fehlende Zeit oder fehlende Ressourcen. Heute? Heute haben wir alles in der Hosentasche.

Ich beobachte gerade etwas Spannendes: Während gefühlt jede Woche ein neues AI-Tool launched, kristallisiert sich bei den meisten eine handvoll echter Alltagshelfer heraus.

Hier ein Auszug aus meinen Toolstack:

🧠 Google AI Studio, Claude & ChatGPT – Sparring für komplexe Gedanken, Texte strukturieren
 🎙️ Wispr Flow – Spracherkennung, weil Reden schneller geht als Tippen
 💡 Replit/Lovable – Prototypen bauen ohne Dev-Team
 📊 Kickscale FlexCo Notetaker – Sales-Calls dokumentieren + Coaching nach jedem Gespräch
 ⚙️ FireStart – Prozesse automatisieren, die ich sonst dreimal pro Woche manuell mache

Die Tools sind da. Die Möglichkeiten sind endlos.

Deshalb meine Frage an euch:
Was nützt ihr tagtäglich für Tools?

Im MICE Sales erlebe ich täglich starke Gespräche:
auf Messen, bei Netzwerkveranstaltungen, im 1:1.
Viel Interesse. Gute Energie. Konkrete Chancen.
Der Unterschied entsteht danach.

Schon vor einigen Jahren dachte ich:
Ein Tool, das Messegespräche recorded, richtig zuordnet und nach Relevanz auswertet – das wäre ein echter Game Changer. 😎

Ende letzten Jahres kam ich mit Mariam Sarwari ins Gespräch. Heute arbeitet sie in der Tech-Welt – mit Hospitality Background. Als sie mir erklärte, woran sie arbeitet, war klar: Genau diese Lösung gibt es jetzt. 🤩

Ich habe das Tool direkt eingeführt – und nutze es täglich.

Das Ergebnis:
🚀 Klare Gesprächszusammenfassungen
🚀 Relevante Insights auf einen Blick
🚀 Automatisierte, persönliche Follow-ups basierend auf dem Gespräch
🚀 Mehr Struktur. Mehr Fokus. Mehr Abschlussqualität.

Für mich ist es fester Bestandteil meines Daily Business geworden.
Effizient. Durchdacht. Mit sehr gutem Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis.

Deshalb habe ich für morgen gemeinsam mit Mariam von Kickscale FlexCo ein exklusives Lunch & Learn für unsere MICE Community organisiert.

👉 Alle Infos findest du in den Kommentaren.

Wenn du als Hotel oder Venue deine Sales-Gespräche konsequent in Ergebnisse verwandeln möchtest, sollte dieses Lunch & Learn prio haben.

Ich habe zu Mariam direkt gesagt: Das müssen wir teilen. Denn fast jede zweite Frage, die ich höre, ist: „Gibt es ein KI-Tool im Sales, das Zeit spart und trotzdem persönlich bleibt?“

Ja. Gibt es.

Wer glaubt, Forecasting ist nur Excel und Glück, hat noch nie mit Frank Piotraschke von octonomy gearbeitet. 💡

Frank hat nicht einfach ein Revenue-Team geführt – er hat es gebaut. Von 0 auf über 200 Sales-Leute bei SoSafe. Über 500 Mitarbeitende gesamt. Und ich kann sagen: Kaum jemand versteht Wachstum und Sales-Strukturen so wie er.

Wir haben uns damals zufällig bei einem Speaker-Dinner auf der ARRtist kennengelernt (Danke an Julius Göllner für die Bühne!). 🍽️ Ich wollte SoSafe schon lange als Kunde – hat damals nicht geklappt. Aber das Leben schreibt die besseren Geschichten. 😅

Letztes Jahr wieder bei der ARRtist, wieder mit Frank gesprochen. Diesmal war klar: Da kommt was Neues. Und dann kam octonomy.

Frank, Moritz und das ganze Team setzen jetzt auf Kickscale FlexCo.
Das macht mich echt stolz. 🙏

Warum? Weil wir gemeinsam Forecasting und Produktivität auf ein neues Level bringen:

- Gesprächsdaten landen direkt in HubSpot. Kein Copy-Paste mehr. 📝
- AI Insights helfen beim Coaching und bei der Reflexion. 🤖
- Strukturierte Sales-Meetings, die echte Ergebnisse liefern. 💥
- Durchgesetzt gegen Gong und einen weiteren Mitbewerber aus den USA.

Das ist nicht nur ein Tool-Upgrade. Das ist Mindset-Shift.

Und das Beste: Wir dürfen schon die erste Case Study dazu machen! (siehe unten 😉)

Danke an Frank, Moritz, Sushel und das octonomy -Team für euer Vertrauen und die Offenheit. Es macht riesigen Spaß, mit Menschen zu arbeiten, die Sales und Wachstum wirklich verstehen.

So sieht echte Sales-Innovation aus. Und ich bin sicher: Da kommt noch mehr.

Wer wissen will, wie Forecasting in 2026 wirklich funktioniert – einfach melden! 🚀

Wenn wir heute über TechStacks sprechen, dann geht’s nicht um möglichst viele Tools auf einer Folie, sondern darum, was wirklich Mehrwert schafft: weniger Tipparbeit, mehr Insights, mehr Umsatz. 📈

💡 Zwei Trends, die wir aktuell spannend finden:
1) KI-gestützte Revenue Intelligence

Tools wie Kickscale FlexCo zeigen, wo’s langgeht.
Statt Stunden damit zu verbringen, CRM-Daten zusammenzukratzen, analysiert KickScale automatisch Sales-Gespräche, verbindet sie mit deinem CRM und liefert dir echte Erkenntnisse über Deals, Kundenbedürfnisse und Pipeline-Trends, alles in Echtzeit und DSGVO-konform.
🔥 Das heißt weniger Bauchgefühl, mehr datenbasierte Entscheidungen.

2) KI-gestütztes Sales-Training 

Statt klassischer eLearning-Videos trainieren Teams heute aktiv ihre Skills: Sleak AI - KI im Verkaufstraining simuliert reale Verkaufsgespräche mit KI-Käufer-Bots und gibt direkt individuelles Feedback, angepasst an Kundenprofile und Methodiken. Das hilft, echte Gesprächs-Skills strukturiert weiterzuentwickeln, ganz ohne externe Trainer.

📊 Was bedeutet das für go-to-market-Teams?
🔥 Weniger repetitive Arbeit.
🔥 Mehr Fokus auf Kunden & Strategie.
🔥 Tech, das wirklich arbeitsentlastend wirkt (und nicht nur „nice to have“ ist).

Am Ende zählt: der Stack muss dich schneller, smarter und klarer im Markt machen.

Been following the work at Spectral Compute and it’s great to see the progress they’re making with SCALE.

They’ve been shipping updates fast—from running GOMC seamlessy on AMD hardware earlier this year, to their just-released December update on GROMACS showing some impressive speedups over SYCL and HIP.
​
For years, vendor lock-in has been a headache for high-performance computing. Tools like this that bridge the gap—allowing existing CUDA projects to compile natively for other GPUs without rewriting code—are exactly what the ecosystem needs.

The team also recently raised $6M led by Costanoa Ventures & Crucible Capital to keep pushing this forward. If you’re working with CUDA but want more hardware options, it’s worth a look.

In the case of GROMACS on AMD GPUs... yes.

We've spent the last few months digging deep into GROMACS after some great feedback from their team.

Today, we're sharing a major update:

✅ CUDA Graphs fully supported
✅ 100% Test Suite pass rate
✅ ~1.6x faster than the HIP backend

We are still chasing the hand-tuned SYCL backend (kudos to them!), but for a drop-in solution requiring zero code changes to your CUDA codebase, we are closing the gap fast.

That means every candidate should be treated consistently, not differently based on noise, proxies, or randomness in the system.

It also means transparency. If AI influences whether you move forward in a hiring process, you have the right to understand why. Decisions that affect people’s access to work cannot be black boxes!

And finally, it has to be robust and repeatable. If AI recommends you for the next step today, it should do the same tomorrow under the exact same conditions. Fairness breaks the moment outcomes become unpredictable.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7420158884574740482","Yes","The rise of lawsuits in the US relating to candidates challenging the use of AI in hiring continues to put some important topics firmly in the spotlight. I’m not aiming to predict the outcome of any specific case, that’s for the courts to decide - but the questions being raised truly matter.

At the heart of our industry are the concerns many candidates are increasingly asking:
- How was AI used in this decision?
- What data was used and where did it come from?
- Can the outcome be explained clearly and credibly?

These are fair questions. And they highlight that candidate-centric AI starts with a simple principle: 
If a hiring decision can’t be explained clearly the technology isn’t doing its job. Over-dependence on black-boxes in critical parts of the candidate assessment and feedback lead to unacceptable levels of risk to enterprises and the fundamental rights of candidates.

At Hubert, we are obsessed about candidate experience, accuracy and explainability - and we are committed to doing AI hiring the right way. 
That’s why we believe:
- New technologies should always put the experience and rights of the candidates first.
- AI should support human decisions, not automate decisions.
- Candidates deserve to know when AI is involved and how it’s used (a future regulatory requirement)
- Assessments should be structured and repeatable, and grounded in scientifically proven methodologies, in order to be accurate, consistent and fair.

As AI becomes more embedded in hiring, scrutiny will increase - from candidates, regulators, and the market. That’s not something to fear, it’s healthy but it is something to prepare for.

Over the coming weeks, here at Hubert we’ll be sharing more on:
- What explainable hiring really looks like in practice
- How to spot and mitigate risks before they become a problem
- How to implement AI in hiring in a safe way for both the candidate and the enterprise
- And the questions every TA leader should be able to answer with confidence

Because trust in hiring doesn’t come from avoiding hard conversations.
It’s built by leading them – clearly, responsibly, and with candidates at the core.

Fairness at scale. Volumes will keep increasing and CVs will keep looking the same. Our responsibility is to make sure every candidate gets the same structured, respectful, and transparent first step without any shortcuts or guessing.

Delivering amazing candidate experiences. Applying for a job should not feel like sending your profile into a black hole. Every candidate deserves feedback, clarity, and a process that respects their time. A good experience is not a nice-to-have, it’s part of being a serious employer.

Responsible AI that is responsible by design. AI that recruiters can trust and candidates can understand. If AI affects people’s access to work, it has to be built with that weight in mind.

Freeing humans to do human-work, like spending time on building relationships, assessing culture, and making better final hiring decisions.

The companies that win in hiring will not be the ones that automate the most, they will be the ones that use AI to become fairer, more human, and more consistent.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7399794656768692225","Yes","I read an interesting article recently about why the world’s top talent should bet on Stockholm.

It highlighted something I’ve felt for a long time: Stockholm isn’t just a beautiful city, it’s a global hub for AI innovation. 

According to Fast Company, Sweden now ranks among the top five most innovative economies in the world. The city has produced more unicorns per capita than anywhere else outside Silicon Valley, and about 20% of those companies are building with AI at their core.

I’m proud that our team at Hubert is part of this eco-system and growing in an environment where real breakthroughs happen.

The article called Stockholm “a place where innovation meets purpose”. I couldn’t agree more. 

If you’re a builder, researcher, or leader in tech, this city should be on your radar. It’s proof that you don’t have to move to Silicon Valley to build something world-changing.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7397587089401384960","Yes","Important reflections from our CPO, Fredrik Törn, on the EU’s decision to delay enforcement of the high-risk rules in the AI Act.

While many see this as extra breathing room, the reality is more complex — and, for hiring, much more serious.

The delay means:
 • Unvalidated and opaque “AI magic” tools will stay in the market until Dec 2027.
 • Questionable recruitment AI practices will continue to impact candidates unfairly.
 • Vendors who should be preparing today may now postpone responsible development.
 • The industry will operate with prolonged uncertainty around requirements and certification.

At Hubert, we share the frustration. We’ve spent years investing in transparency, fairness, and explainability, not because the law told us to, but because people deserve better.

The best organisations aren’t waiting for regulation to do the right thing. Responsible AI in hiring should already be the standard.

If anything, this delay reinforces why we’re committed to:
 • Building transparent, validated, and explainable AI
 • Fully aligning with the EU AI Act — ahead of time
 • Helping organisations future-proof their recruitment processes now
 • Supporting clear benchmarks for accuracy, fairness, and robustness

The article below summarises why the delay matters and why the industry must keep moving forward despite it.

Doing the right thing for people should never be delayed.

Každej den někdo někde launchuje něco, vydává novou verzi něčeho, vychází nový LLM tady, nová AI tam, ale... přijde mi, že skoro nikdo neřeší to nejdůležitější. #Data.



A od toho jsme tu my. Boost.space.

Posledních pár měsíců jsme se zavřeli do officů, home officů, sklepů, pokojíčků a obejváků, kde nám křičely a pobíhali okolo děcka a dělali na v5.

A teď, po těch X měsících přichází náš největší release so far. Pro představu a kontext se jedná o více než 100.000 řádků kódu (BE & FE) jenom pro tento release.

Ale to samozřejmě není to PROČ dojít. PROČ u toho být a vidět to.

To hlavní PROČ je, že ať už chcete nebo ne - pokud máte AI a automatizaci využívat efektivně, tak dřív nebo později budete potřebovat místo, kde budete mít jeden zdroj pravdy (taky se občas používá SSOT).

Nebo teda... databázi. Což nezní tak sexy. Ale pořád je to must-have. A co třeba databázi, která kromě toho, že je #nocode, tak je taky stavěná PŘÍMO pro účely a potřeby Make automatizací a AI agentů.

Takže pokud je tohle něco, co rezonuje aspoň trochu - není nic víc easy, než se registrovat a věnovat hodinu času 17. 2. odpoledne, kdy stejně už jenom koukáme z oken a chystáme se domů. Za těma křičícíma a ječícíma dětma. Nice.

After overseeing 140,782 Make automations, I’ve learned one undeniable truth: Your AI is only as powerful as the data it can reason over.

We’ve all been there—building brilliant, complex automation scenarios only to watch them become ""fragile hacks"" because the underlying data layer couldn't scale. It’s like trying to run a marathon in flip-flops🩴 

You can make it work for a while, but eventually, the foundation gives way.

We’ve spent years working with clients and companies of all sizes from all around the world to solve this exact problem with Boost.space. We didn't want to build just another ""AI tool."" We wanted to build the infrastructure that makes AI & AI workflows actually work for business. Of all sizes. With whatever toolstack.

That’s why I’m so excited to finally open up Boost.space v5: The first AI Agentic Database for Make 🤞

This is the ""Brain"" your scenarios have been waiting for. By using #MCP (Model Context Protocol), we’ve turned the database into a cognitive engine. 

It allows your LLMs to directly query and reason over live business data, turning isolated automations into a compounding, intelligent system.

I’m personally inviting anyone who is serious about the future of #automation to join our Global Launch. This is the end of the ""flip-flop"" era. It’s time to build on a foundation that scales. 

❌ Not on spreadsheets, not on ""databases"" ment for apps.

""Software as a Service ist tot."" Das liest und hört man immer wieder. 

Glaubst du das wirklich? Ich nicht. Warum? Ganz einfach:

Ja, es stimmt, dass Softwareentwicklung einfacher wird – und mit KI wird das noch weitergehen. Vielleicht können wir irgendwann sogar komplexe Systeme fast autonom entwickeln. 

Der Punkt ist jedoch: Die initiale Entwicklung ist nicht der größte Aufwand oder der größte Kostenfaktor. Die wahre Herausforderung liegt woanders:
➡️Betrieb und Wartung: Software muss auf dem neuesten Stand bleiben. Compliance-Richtlinien ändern sich ständig, Sicherheitsanforderungen steigen, und Updates sind nicht optional.
➡️Support und Weiterentwicklung: Nutzererwartungen ändern sich, neue Features müssen implementiert werden, und Bugs wollen behoben werden.
➡️Einsatz von KI: Auch SaaS-Anbieter nutzen KI, um ihre Lösungen kontinuierlich zu verbessern.

Die Frage ist also nicht, ob Unternehmen Software kaufen oder selbst entwickeln sollten. 

Die eigentliche Frage ist: 

Sind Unternehmen bereit, die Verantwortung und den Aufwand für Betrieb, Compliance, Support und Weiterentwicklung selbst zu tragen?

SaaS bietet hier klare Vorteile: Anbieter wie amber übernehmen einen Großteil dieser Verantwortung. Sie entwickeln nicht nur die Software, sondern sorgen auch dafür, dass sie zukunftssicher bleibt. Das erlaubt Unternehmen, sich auf das zu konzentrieren, was wirklich zählt: ihr Kerngeschäft.

Der EU AI-Act ist seit 2025 Realität und hat die Rahmenbedingungen für den Einsatz von Künstlicher Intelligenz in Europa grundlegend verändert.

Besonders für mittelständische Unternehmen, die KI bereits einsetzen oder dies planen, ist es essenziell, die neuen Anforderungen zu verstehen und umzusetzen. Doch was bedeutet das konkret?

Die wichtigsten Fakten zum EU AI-Act:

➡️Risikoeinstufung von KI-Systemen: Der AI-Act teilt Anwendungen in vier Risikostufen ein – von minimalem bis hin zu nicht akzeptablem Risiko. Diese Einordnung entscheidet, welche Sicherheits- und Transparenzanforderungen gelten.
➡️Verbote und Einschränkungen: Bestimmte KI-Anwendungen, wie etwa manipulative oder diskriminierende Systeme, sind strikt verboten. Das betrifft z. B. automatisierte Entscheidungen im Personalbereich.
➡️Pflichten für Unternehmen: Wer KI einsetzt, muss sicherstellen, dass alle Vorgaben eingehalten werden – von der Datenqualität bis hin zur Nachvollziehbarkeit der Entscheidungen. Dafür sind technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen notwendig.
➡️Anbieterauswahl: Viele Anbieter werben mit ""EU AI-Act-konformen Lösungen"". Doch was heißt das konkret? Unternehmen müssen genau prüfen, ob ein Anbieter die Anforderungen tatsächlich erfüllt oder ob dies nur ein Marketingversprechen ist.

Was bedeutet das für dich?

✅Prüfung bestehender KI-Systeme: Sind sie bereits konform mit den neuen Vorgaben? Falls nicht, drohen rechtliche Konsequenzen.
✅Schulung der Mitarbeitenden: Dein Team muss nicht nur die KI verstehen, sondern auch wissen, wie sie diese regelkonform einsetzen.
✅Langfristige Strategie: Der AI-Act ist erst der Anfang. Eine klare KI-Strategie hilft dir, zukünftige Änderungen proaktiv anzugehen.
Dein nächster Schritt: Wissen aufbauen

Die gute Nachricht: Du musst nicht allein herausfinden, was der AI-Act für dein Unternehmen bedeutet!

In unserem Webinar am 19. Februar 2026 um 10:00 Uhr klären wir die wichtigsten Fragen – von den Risikostufen über Anbieterauswahl bis hin zu Schulungsanforderungen.

Vor über 5 Jahren haben wir amber mit der Vision gegründet, internes Unternehmenswissen schnell und einfach zugänglich zu machen. 

Aus dem Internet kannten wir Google - im Unternehmen haben wir es schmerzlich vermisst. Unser erstes Produkt war daher amberSearch - eine Art Google für all deine internen Datenquellen. Sicher und mit Berücksichtigung aller Zugriffsrechte.

Mittlerweile ist so viel mehr daraus geworden:

➡️amberAI: Ein KI-Assistent, der verschiedene KI-Modelle sicher und DSGVO-konform mit deinem Unternehmenswissen kombiniert.
➡️amberAgents: Automatisierung von wiederkehrenden Aufgaben – einfach und effizient. Tief integriert in deine IT-Infrastruktur.

Was amber unschlagbar macht?

Wir denken eine KI-Plattform vom Unternehmenswissen aus - nicht andersherum. Bei uns steht das Unternehmen mit seinem Wissen an erster Stelle - nicht die KI.

Im letzten Jahr kam bei uns immer wieder die Frage auf, wie wir uns in Zukunft positionieren möchten.

Gestartet sind wir 2020 als Anbieter für unternehmensinterne Suchlösungen. 

Im Laufe der Zeit haben wir uns jedoch zu einer umfassenden KI-Lösung weiterentwickelt. Im Zentrum unseres Handelns stand dabei stets das Ziel, unternehmensinternes Wissen bestmöglich zugänglich zu machen.

Oberste Prämisse war es stets, echten Mehrwert zu liefern und nicht dem nächsten Hype hinterher zu rennen. 

In den letzten Jahren hat ist der KI-Markt jedoch stark gereift, und mit ihm haben auch wir uns weiterentwickeln.

Bei der letzten Überarbeitung unserer Webseite war noch nicht klar, ob wir uns langfristig als Anbieter für interne Suchlösungen oder als umfassende KI-Plattform positionieren möchten.

Heute wissen wir: Mit amber bedienen wir beides. Und die Differenzierung beider Ansätze ist enorm wichtig.

Warum beides? Weil es letztlich darum geht, internes Wissen zugänglich zu machen – und das gelingt nur mit einer qualitativ hochwertigen Suche. Es reicht nicht, einfach Dokumente hochzuladen oder unzuverlässige Konnektoren zu nutzen.

Gleichzeitig wird das Thema KI immer präsenter und wird in diesem Jahr tief in die Prozesse von Unternehmen integriert. Deshalb müssen auch KI und Agenten eine entsprechend große Rolle in unserem Angebot spielen.

Diese Überlegungen haben uns dazu veranlasst, unsere Website zu überarbeiten. Es handelt sich zwar nicht um einen kompletten Relaunch, aber es ist ein bedeutender Schritt nach vorne – ein neuer Software-Launch, der unsere Entwicklung widerspiegelt.

2026 – das Jahr, in dem sich die Spielregeln ändern. Unternehmen, die KI als Wettbewerbsvorteil sehen, könnten bald aufwachen und feststellen: Es ist kein Vorteil mehr, sondern eine Grundvoraussetzung. Der Einsatz von Künstlicher Intelligenz wird zum Status quo.

Warum?

Weil die Wirtschaft unter Druck steht. Effizienz, Automatisierung und schlanke Prozesse sind nicht länger ein „Nice-to-have“, sondern ein Muss.

Und während einige Unternehmen noch zögern, haben andere längst begonnen, KI strategisch einzusetzen.

Sie bauen nicht nur einzelne Lösungen, sondern ganze Systeme von Assistenten und Automatisierungen.

Mitarbeitende, die richtig geschult wurden, entwickeln eigene Lösungen und heben das Potenzial von KI auf ein neues Level.

Doch es gibt einen Haken: Der Einstieg entscheidet oft über den Erfolg:

Projekte, die nur auf den Kauf einiger KI-Lizenzen beschränkt waren, scheitern häufig.

Warum?

Weil es an Struktur, Integration und einem klaren Ziel fehlt. KI ist kein Plug-and-Play. Es braucht eine durchdachte Einführung und Unterstützung.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412770256345219072","Yes","2026: Auf diese Trends setze ich, wenn es um KI im Mittelstand geht

KI ist endgültig im Arbeitsalltag angekommen und verändert die Spielregeln für mittelständische Unternehmen. Letztes Jahr habe ich zu Anfang des Jahres gesagt, dass KI-Agenten im Mittelstand in 2025 nicht den Durchbruch schaffen werden. Bis heute sehe ich keine großflächigen Roll Outs von KI-Agenten im Mittelstand - höchstens erste Ansätze. 

Doch das wird sich im Jahr 2026 massiv ändern. Hype verblasst immer mehr, denn es geht immer mehr um echte Produktivität und greifbare Mehrwerte. Was erwartet uns also im neuen Jahr?

1️⃣ KI-Agenten werden produktiv 
Digitale Agenten übernehmen zentrale Aufgaben in Buchhaltung, Vertrieb und HR. Sie kombinieren Unternehmensdaten, erkennen Fehler und schlagen Optimierungen vor. Entscheidend ist nicht das Modell, sondern die Integration in Prozesse.

2️⃣ Datenqualität als Schlüssel 
Gute Daten sind der wahre Engpass. Erfolgreiche Unternehmen setzen auf saubere Datenquellen und KI-Systeme, die ihre Sprache und Prozesse verstehen und somit tief integriert sind anstatt nur oberflächlich zu agieren.

3️⃣ Gedächtnis als Wettbewerbsvorteil 
KI mit „persistent memory“ wird zum zentralen Wissensspeicher. Wer auf ein System setzt, das sich an interne Prozesse und den Unternehmensstil erinnert, bleibt langfristig dabei – ein echter Lock-in-Vorteil. Eine Funktion, die wir mit amber sowohl auf Unternehmens- als auch auf Nutzerebene unterstützen.

4️⃣ No-Code wird Realität 
Mitarbeitende entwickeln ihre eigenen KI-Tools & Assistenten mit einfachen Prompt-Buildern. Das spart Zeit, Outsourcing-Kosten und macht das Team produktiver.

5️⃣ KI als Arbeits-Hub 
Durch pragmatische Tool-Integration entsteht ein zentrales Interface für CRM, Buchhaltung, Content und mehr – alles KI-gestützt. Erste Aktionen in Drittsystemen sind mit amber schon jetzt möglich & weitere werden folgen.

6️⃣ Marketing neu gedacht 
Sichtbarkeit in LLMs wie ChatGPT wird essenziell. Marken müssen sicherstellen, dass sie dort gefunden und empfohlen werden.

7️⃣ Audio als Interaktionsmedium
Sprache wird zum neuen Interface. Immer mehr Mitarbeitende nutzen Diktier- und Sprachfunktionen, um Informationen schneller und intuitiver zugänglich zu machen

8️⃣ Menschlichkeit im Fokus 
Gerade wegen KI rücken persönliche Interaktionen und Erinnerungen wieder in den Fokus. Was automatisiert wird, wird automatisiert. Doch der Wert des Zwischenmenschlichen an der richtigen Stelle wird steigen.

Was bedeutet das für den Mittelstand? 

Der KI Zug ist nicht abgefahren - aber er rollt mit hoher Geschwindigkeit aus dem Bahnhof. Nun werden Learnings aus den letzten Jahren produktiv angewendet. Ab jetzt wächst der Vorsprung exponentiell. Darum geht es jetzt darum, Mehrwerte zu realisieren und KI für alle im Unternehmen nutzbar zu machen!

Am 30. November 2022 ging ChatGPT als „Research Preview“ online. Heute, drei Jahre später, ist klar: KI hat nicht nur die Tech-Welt, sondern ganze Branchen revolutioniert. 

Was damals als Experiment von OpenAI begann, hat ein globales Wettrennen um Innovationen ausgelöst – und auch unser Geschäft bei #amber massiv verändert.

Rückblickend hätten wir viele der heutigen Use Cases vor vier Jahren nicht für möglich gehalten. 

Doch es hat sich gezeigt: KI ist im Alltag angekommen und wird bleiben. Wer sie konsequent einsetzt, verschiebt die Grenzen von Effizienz und Qualität.

Aber: Der Unterschied liegt nicht im Zugang zu Modellen. Er liegt darin, KI sinnvoll in Prozesse, Produkte und Organisationen zu integrieren. 

Genau hier trennt sich die Spreu vom Weizen. Regulation, Verantwortung und Ethik sind längst keine „Nice-to-haves“ mehr – sie sind Pflichtaufgaben für Unternehmen, die KI skalieren wollen.

Für uns bei amber heißt das: Weniger Hype, mehr Umsetzung. Weniger Folien, mehr messbare Ergebnisse. Also genau das, wofür wir bei amber stehen.

Vielleicht ist der dritte Geburtstag von ChatGPT ein guter Moment, um sich zwei Fragen zu stellen:

➡️ Welche Aufgaben erledigen Menschen noch, die eine Maschine inzwischen besser, schneller oder konsistenter könnte?
➡️Wo braucht es jetzt mehr menschliche Urteilsfähigkeit, weil KI neue Hebel – aber auch neue Risiken – schafft?

Die nächsten drei Jahre werden nicht langsamer. Wer heute experimentiert, lernt. Wer wartet, wird überholt.","Bastian Maiworm","activity","urn:li:share:7401161304440201217","2025-11-22","Valid 7401161305753014273","ACoAACmSGNMBwQmc-hIFGaCVxBmNp-Ugay8Gw1k","ACwAACmS","ACwAACmSGNMB_0B7bEvsihxoEDeZdbezP51e4hY","ACwAACmS","✅ Record Found","true",,false

- In light of AMLA, what needs updating in our AML policy?

What started as a thesis back in November has now grown into one of the most in-demand AI workshops in compliance.

The goal with the workshop has always been simple for us at Zango:

Give non-technical professionals practical, hands-on AI skills they can immediately use with the AI tools already at their disposal to do their jobs better.

Because there’s a real gap.

In large organisations, the lack of AI training in functions like legal, risk, and compliance is becoming a serious issue. And it’s leading to three patterns:

- Decision-makers who don’t fully understand AI so they avoid adopting it in their teams.

- Leaders who don’t understand it but feel pressured to act like they do resulting in sub-optimal decisions.

- A small group of ambitious professionals spending £30,000 – £50,000 out of their own pockets on university diplomas and executive AI programmes.

None of this is sustainable.

Traditionally, lawyers handled the high-value work. Financial institutions wouldn't use them for everything because of the cost, but they needed them for critical matters. Consultants did the grunt work, and software played only a minor role esp in risk and compliance.

How will this balance evolve?

AI will certainly play a larger role, but the question is: will lawyers and financial institutions partner directly with tech firms (that will displace consultants) or will consultants find ways to integrate AI themselves and protect their business?

Zango’s AI agents turn regulatory complexity into obligations, compliance and product teams can actually work with.

We start by identifying all relevant laws, decrees, regulations, and guidelines for a given product and country.

We then use AI to extract and normalize the obligations (KYC requirements, onboarding rules, risk checks).

These obligations are organized into a clear, readable view by topic, tagged as prescriptive or risk-based, and mapped to the relevant product flows.

Product and compliance teams can review, verify, and track progress in one place.

The result is a shared roadmap that keeps both teams aligned from regulation to user journey.

He’s been bringing AI out of experimental pilots and into the practical realities of compliance operations.

In our latest conversation, Victor offers a grounded, practitioner’s view on what it actually takes to make AI work inside a large financial institution.

We discuss:

 Where AI is already delivering real efficiency gains 
 Why explainability and governance remain the hardest challenges
 How compliance teams need to evolve skills, controls, and culture
 Why AI should augment - not replace - human judgement in compliance

🇪🇺 EU - statute-led, horizontal regulation via the EU AI Act, with obligations tied to risk tiers. The Commission’s recent proposed amendments to the Act aim to reduce complexity and compliance burdens.

🇬🇧 UK - context-based, sector-led oversight within existing regulatory regimes (e.g. by FCA, Ofcom, etc). No AI-specific regulation is likely in the short term except perhaps on AI chatbots, but targeted, pro-growth AI legislative interventions may emerge.

🇺🇸 US - fragmented, State-level AI laws combined with federal enforcement of existing consumer, competition, and civil rights rules. President Trump’s recent Executive Order makes clear his resistance to state-level regulation, but lacks the force to stop it. 

🇸🇬 Singapore - supervisory, capability-driven governance led by regulators such as MAS, focused on how AI is designed, deployed, and controlled in practice rather than formal risk categories.

No era una foto de celebración.
 Era una foto de partido.

El lunes Cinco Días abrió su sección de Empresas e Inversión con este artículo.
 Hablaba de una ronda de inversión.
 Pero, en realidad, hablaba de fútbol.

Del cierre de la ronda que STAMP acaba de completar.
 De la entrada en el capital de un jugador de élite global
 y del club que cambió para siempre cómo se vive el fútbol como experiencia.

Y lo más interesante no fue el hito empresarial.

Fue la imagen.

Porque el fútbol —uno de los mayores negocios de entretenimiento del mundo, con millones de fans— entiende algo esencial:
 👉 la experiencia lo es todo.

El fútbol no es solo deporte.
 Es entretenimiento.
 Es atención.
 Es emoción.

Millones de personas vuelan miles de kilómetros por vivir una experiencia. ✈️
 Cruzan fronteras.
 Cambian de huso horario.
 Y esperan que todo fluya.

También el pago.
 También el VAT.
 También el último detalle.

Por eso el fútbol entiende algo antes que muchos sectores:
 la tecnología no está para verse.
 Está para no notarse.

Lo que más me ha sorprendido no ha sido el anuncio.
 Ha sido la reacción.

Una foto.
 Un relato.
 Más interés que el propio logro corporativo.

Nunca antes había visto una publicación así en LinkedIn.
 Y tengo la sensación de que no va a ser ni la primera… ni la última.

Porque cuando el fútbol se mueve,
 no se mueve solo el balón.

Se mueve la atención.
 Se mueve la experiencia.
 Se mueve el negocio. 🚀

¿Qué otros sectores entenderán a tiempo que la experiencia ya no es un “extra”, sino el producto?

But honestly?
The money is the least interesting part.

What matters is who is building this.

To change global commerce, you can’t sit in one office
with people who all look and think the same.

That’s why we’re 30 people, holding passports from East to West 🌍 —
from China 🇨🇳, through Italy 🇮🇹, Spain 🇪🇸 and Germany 🇩🇪,
to Argentina 🇦🇷 and Uruguay 🇺🇾 among others.

We work across Madrid, Milan and Valencia 💻.

We’re global because our DNA is global.

Diversity isn’t a KPI for us.
It’s an operational necessity.

Then there’s the capital itself.

We had a choice:
go the traditional VC route
or find partners who actually get it.

We chose the latter.

Because when you want to change a system —
not just optimize it —
you need conviction, not just spreadsheets 📊.

Proud to have Dozen Investments , EBISU Digital VC , Barça Innovation Hub and Thibaut Courtois ( NXTPLAY ) ⚽ as well as Giuliana Berchicci , Andreas Mihalovits and CH1EF on this ride with us.

This isn’t just about funding.
It’s about the freedom to execute.

Let’s get to work. 🔥

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7420009868176015360","Yes","For years, I felt like I didn’t really fit in.

Not in school.
Not in standard paths.
Not in what was considered “normal”.

It didn’t matter if it was a Spanish school
or an almost entirely German one.

I never felt at home in predefined boxes.

And I never minded questioning the status quo.
“How things have always been done.”
Structures.
Systems.

As long as values were respected,
everything else felt open to be challenged.

That came at a cost.
Often suffering more than others.

But that’s part of the game
when you don’t yet know where you fit.

So I kept moving.

After school, I went to the US 🇺🇸
I worked at McDonald’s and in hotels.
Not to build a résumé —
but to see if the American Dream was actually real.

Then I went back to Germany 🇩🇪
to finish university.

After that, I moved to Austria 🇦🇹 to work.
Later, back to Germany again.

I kept searching.
Because staying still felt worse than moving.

I studied at Esade  🎓
Then in California, at the Santa Clara University ,
to understand Silicon Valley from the inside 💻

At some point, I took a break
and travelled around the world 🌍

Cuba. Malawi. Myanmar.

Different systems.
Different rules.
Different versions of “normal”.

When I came back to Spain 🇪🇸, something was clear:
if I was going to build something,
it had to be from my roots.

That’s when I studied at IESE Business School .
Not to fit in —
but to sharpen my own way of thinking.

Looking back, it finally makes sense.

I wasn’t lost.
I wasn’t unfocused.

I just didn’t fit into standard paths.

And that turned out to be the point.

If you’ve ever felt the same —
questioning more, suffering more,
but unable to accept things just because
“they’ve always been that way” —

maybe there’s nothing wrong with you.

Maybe you’re just wired to build something different ✨

A quiet frustration.

There’s an abysmal difference between optimizing a process
 and questioning its foundations.

That’s why Alvaro Fontaneda, J. Javier Castrillo and I decided to come together.

I’ve spent years in this industry.
 At first, I fell into the trap of trying to improve what already existed.

But the system wasn’t slow.
 It was broken.

I identified two massive frictions no one seemed willing to face:

→ The lie of “Tax Free”.
 In reality, it was Tax Refund.
 The customer pays, queues, fills forms and waits.
 A terrible user experience.

→ The disconnection in payments.
 Chinese tourists wanting to pay with WeChat or Alipay — their daily tools —
 forced to use cash or cards they don’t even use back home.

Many pay in cash in Europe
 not because they want to,
 but because they have no alternative.

💸 Billions left on the table.

I’ve just come back from China 🇨🇳
 and I faced the same problem.

You adapt.
 You consume less.

That’s when it became obvious:

🚨 Global commerce is broken.

Making a process 10% faster is easy.
That’s how monopolies protect the status quo.
 Questioning it is what really changes things.

That’s when Sebastian Perez joined.
 And operational frustration turned into a cutting-edge tech infrastructure.

So we didn’t start STAMP to optimize a system.
 We started it to question it.

Because STAMP is just a name.
 Behind it, a shared vision to change global commerce.

✨ Innovation is not doing the same thing faster.
 It’s having the courage to do it radically different.

So tell me —
 are you fixing something old,
 or building something new?

Hay dos caminos reales para construir un proyecto ganador:

1️⃣ Copiar algo que ya existe, elegir muy bien el nicho o el mercado y escalar rápido.
2️⃣ O ir un paso más allá: crear un nuevo monopolio.

Lo que casi nunca funciona:
👉 mejorar ligeramente la propuesta de valor dentro de un mercado competido.

Lo sé porque ya me equivoqué antes haciendo eso.
Y cuando te das cuenta… ya estás atrapado.

Por eso la gran mayoría sigue mirando a #USA o #América.
No por estrategia.
Sino por tamaño, idioma y comodidad.

La respuesta fue clara: STAMP

No por marketing.
 Por lógica.
Cuando comparas en serio:

 📍 Mismo marco regulatorio
 📍 Mismo nivel de seguridad y compliance
 📍 Mismo o menor riesgo para el retailer

STAMP gana porque:

 – Muestra el precio real desde el inicio
 – Reduce fricción en el punto de venta
 – Aumenta conversión y ticket medio
 – Devuelve el control al merchant

El tax refund tradicional sigue siendo un proceso financiero.
 STAMP Real Tax Free es una herramienta de venta.

Por eso, cuando todas las condiciones son iguales, la recomendación también lo es.

The coverage specifically highlights our efforts to finally address four decades of operational confusion and our proposed model for a modern, streamlined tax-free system. This recognition validates the urgent need for #Innovation and regulatory clarity in this high-impact sector in #Spain. We believe this is a crucial step toward true #FinancialReform.

Our system is designed to facilitate VAT-free payment at the point of sale in countries such as Italy, and to allow the VAT amount to be discounted from the total payment, as in countries like Spain (the invoice is always issued with VAT/IVA).

Nunca usaba el vino bueno para sus mezclas.
Si tenía dudas, sacaba la gaseosa, y me decía: ""Abel, los experimentos, con vino y gaseosa”.

Lo llamaba «los experimentos».
Y tardé años en entender que aquello era una lección magistral de management.

En la empresa a veces confundimos innovar con apostar la casa.
Ponemos en juego patrimonio y reputación a puerta cerrada.

Abrimos el Gran Reserva antes de saber si a alguien le gusta el sabor.

Pero la validación real funciona al revés.
Se trata de minimizar el coste del error.

En el mundo corporativo lo llamamos Lean o MVP, pero la lógica es la de esa mesa de domingo:

→ La «gaseosa» son tus prototipos low-cost
→ El «experimento» es el feedback del mercado
→ El «vino bueno» es la inversión cuando ya hay tracción

No necesitas una infraestructura perfecta para validar.
Ni contratar un equipo entero antes de cerrar el primer cliente.

💡 El riesgo calculado no es miedo.
Es la inteligencia de saber cuándo testear y cuándo escalar.

La verdadera audacia incluye la prudencia de fallar barato para poder acertar caro.

👉 ¿Estás gastando la gaseosa o descorchando la botella antes de tiempo?

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7402617780321161216","Yes","Numbers often whisper truths to us that our intuition, at times, overlooks.

Diving into the data of my 2025 strategy (40 posts, 10k community), I uncovered revealing conclusions that touch the soul of growth.

It's not magic.
It's the incredible power of compound effect in action, building something great step by step.

Beyond the cold figures, three key tactical findings emerged, deeply resonating with the human experience:

→ Depth always trumps noise. Carousels don't just engage; they connect with the genuine desire to learn, to go beyond a simple scroll.
→ Timing is crucial. Thursday at 1:00 PM, that perfect moment when reflection embraces us.
→ Consistency is the true heart of intensity. Authority isn't born from a viral post, but from that systematic presence that builds trust and respect.

💡 But the most valuable revelation, the one that truly illuminates the path, transcends cold data.

September is, at its core, our true January.

While many wait for resolutions, strategic leaders feel this is the decisive moment, a golden opportunity.

What you build now will forge your positioning for next year, with unstoppable force. Start when others are still settling in, with that spark of anticipation.

👉 Don't let your strategy fade. The compound interest of your brand is a treasure that blossoms over time.

Will you take the reins of your destiny today, with passion, or will you keep waiting?

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7402255413590691841","Yes","I resigned as a Director with zero savings.

I did it after a brilliant executive from one of my clients told me:
“You work for the least bad provider in the industry.”

I was a Director at Global Blue, with corporate security and stability.
My professional life looked perfectly in place.
But something was missing.

Her words triggered a profound reflection.

I looked back at my path—at the challenges, the learning, the international moves, the studies, including my time at ESADE.
And I realized something important:

Real growth only flourishes through discomfort.
With honesty, I admitted I had become comfortable—losing the fire of ambition.

I understood that “security” is often just an illusion.
So I chose to jump into entrepreneurship, pursuing excellence and a higher purpose.

From that transition, I carry four non-negotiable lessons:

1. Comfort is the enemy of our dreams and happiness.
If you don’t feel that spark that pushes you on Mondays, your spirit wants more—you’re stuck.

2. Your past is not your destiny, but the map of your resilience.
Living in three countries (USA, Germany, or Switzerland) doesn’t guarantee success, but it forges you with the strength to embrace uncertainty.

3. Your title stays at the door, but your essence, passion, and impact do not.
The market doesn’t care about your previous role; it values the tangible impact you create today with authenticity and passion.

4. Being “the best” is a decision born from the heart every day.
It’s an unwavering attitude, a rejection of mediocrity, a courageous pursuit of greatness.

Reinvention demands courage and unshakeable self-belief.

And you—when was the last time you chose discomfort over security to embrace your purpose?

His take is clear: while technology is important, the human element is becoming the most critical layer of security in the age of Generative AI. “People should be trained and should be helped to be a defense wall inside a company to strengthen their company”.

👉 The ""Fence"" Problem: Traditional security focuses on technical barriers, but modern attacks blend into everyday workflows.
👉 Enable, don’t blame: Effective security builds confidence and clarity, so people know when and how to raise a signal.
👉The path ahead: Moving from human-centric education to a full security defense platform.

✅ Automated MFA bypass at scale 
✅ Voice and video impersonation - already targeting high-value executives, and becoming accessible to broader attackers

As deepfakes and synthetic identities become indistinguishable from reality, cybersecurity can no longer rely on recognition or verification alone.

I was talking to Julius M., Co-Founder of revel8, to explore why training human behavior under real attack conditions is now the most critical layer of defense.

In our conversation, Julius described the many shifts in the current threat model of cyber attacks that many organisations haven’t fully internalised yet, and how to protect your companies:

“𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘶𝘮𝘦 𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘢𝘤𝘬𝘴 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘤, 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘭-𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘤𝘪𝘧𝘪𝘤, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘷𝘪𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘺 “𝘮𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘰𝘶𝘴.” 𝘉𝘶𝘵 𝘮𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘯 𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘢𝘤𝘬𝘴 𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘥 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘰 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬𝘧𝘭𝘰𝘸𝘴, 𝘴𝘱𝘢𝘯 𝘮𝘶𝘭𝘵𝘪𝘱𝘭𝘦 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘭𝘴, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘰𝘪𝘵 𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘯 𝘵𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭 𝘧𝘭𝘢𝘸𝘴.”

Last weekend, we hosted the Agent Olympics.
For two days straight, hackers went all in, building everything from fully autonomous sea-freight agents to speaking robo-dogs. <3

Once again, this showed what Munich is capable of when it comes to building at the frontier of tech!
Huge respect to all the hackers who brought this energy to life, and to everyone behind the scenes who made the event happen!

A special thank you also to our speakers Erik Muttersbach, Maximilian Hudlberger, Alexander Schmitt & more for setting the tone. The message was clear: Just let us build.
We are keeping that momentum going with the Final Pitch Event of our incubator program next Friday.

On Friday I was at a comedy show in Angel, London.
The MC saw a smiling me in the front row and asked what I did for work.

I told him I work in EVs and the software that processes and reimburses home and public charging for fleets.

Cue… silence.

He then said he had a Nissan Leaf but: “I’ve got no idea what the difference is between charging at home and charging publicly in terms of cost.”

And honestly? He’s not alone.

Here’s the reality from our fleet-wide data:
⚡ Home charge: £5.72
⚡ Public charge: £19.91

That’s a £14.19 difference.

Or, in more scientific terms:
🍫 47 Freddos
(even at their extortionate 30p price)

Now multiply £14.19 by:
• 100 drivers
• 1 charge a day
• 12 months

This isn’t chocolate money anymore, it’s serious fleet spend!

On Friday, we took delivery of our very shiny new Skoda Elroq, courtesy of the salary sacrifice scheme and  Octopus Electric Vehicles. 

First test? A drive to Suffolk, the evening of delivery. 

Total trip, 124 miles, 2 hours 40 mins which equalled 53% of the battery. Not bad for its maiden voyage (and a very cold evening).

We also picked up a granny charger (plugs into a normal socket but is rather slow) so we could borrow a bit of energy from my parents’ house over the weekend. My father only allowed it to start charging at 3am, naturally, at the cheapest possible rate. 

Here’s the quick verdict 

Battery: Slightly lower range than I expected on paper, but in practice? Totally fine. No stress, no drama.

Driving: Whisper-quiet, smooth, packed with clever features and honestly just… fun.

Learning curve: A little jerky at times,  but that’s probably more down to two  newbies adjusting to automatics rater than the electric element.

If you’re like 99.9% of brands, that’s f#cking never. 

Yet, when I was at a food & wine show recently, the rep of a brand (you’ve definitely heard of) stood up and shared this as his ‘growth strategy’...

In these week long retreats, they’d do mixology competitions, ‘networking’ and God knows what else…

(Is it just me or are private islands kinda tainted now? Because of Ep – actually, best not get into that…)

Naturally, I had a question. I asked:

""How do you measure the ROI on renting a private island?""

His answer: ""We don't.""

My follow-up: ""Is there any measurable uplift?""

Answer: ""No.""

Nice one, mate. Thanks for that.

If you’ve got unlimited money to fly people to an island, great.

If you don’t…

Build a community of actual consumers:

- Get them on your email list
- Create direct relationships
- Measure what works
- Get repeat purchases
- Follow the data

When you're building a brand from scratch, you can't afford NOT to.

1. You send me a DM
2. I get you early access to our NEW wineries platform
3. You can encourage visitors to buy wine while on-site and have it shipped to their home
4. After visitors get home, they can also buy directly from you
5. Plus, you can now make sales from your email list of past visitors (simply send them your shop link)

With Tipple, you can ship to customers living in:

🇦🇹 Austria 
🇧🇪 Belgium
🇩🇰 Denmark
🇫🇮 Finland
🇫🇷 France
🇩🇪 Germany
🇮🇹 Italy
🇪🇸 Spain
🇳🇱 Netherlands

How it works is simple:

1. Your customer places the order online
2. You pack the wine
3. We collect it and deliver it, taxes and courier included
4. You make more money

- Now to sell to international customers
- Increase revenue per visitor 
- Monetise your email list (finally)
- Shop internationally without the compliance headache
- Don't need a distributor for this 
- And you have a repeat revenue opportunity

""It's about time!!""

Nothing upsets business owners more than leaving money on the table. 

And because of rules & red tape, wineries have been forced to do this for decades. 

It's a familiar scene:

- Someone visits your winery, loves your wine
- They ask where they can buy it in their country 
- And you have to tell them they can't 

Worse, still, they're standing there (credit card in hand) asking to buy some and have it shipped to their home. But you can't. Because figuring out how to do that yourself is a big task. 

It WAS a big task. But we did the hard work. We figured it out. 

And now it's as simple as:

1. Your visitor scans a QR code
2. They place an order of their favourites bottles
3. You pack the order
4. We collect it via courier, and deliver it to the end user (taxes included) 

In some cases, your bottles will be waiting for them when they get home.

No more leaving cash on the table.

We were speaking to a smaller company last week that develops products using data. 

Smaller dynamic brands see what people are searching for…

Then they build it.

Meanwhile, the big dogs would spend €500k on focus groups, 18 months in development, and still sit on the idea.

Same products. Same approach. Year after year after year. They're the BIC pens equivalent of the booze world.

^^ That’s bollocks.

It works on the idea that bartenders will promote your product. 

Here's the problem with this. Picture the scene:

It's 9pm on a Saturday. The bar is three-deep. Someone's waving a twenty at you like you're a taxi. Another person is asking for ""something fruity but not too sweet."" There's a hen party ordering 14 espresso martinis. Your shirt is soaked through with sweat and something sticky that you really hope is just lemonade. The ice well is half empty. And the card machine just went down. 

Is this the moment you think a bartender is going to become your brand ambassador?

Is this when you're expecting bartenders to educate customers about boutique spirits? 

Fuck no. 

You know what they're actually thinking?

""I need to get through the next 47 drink orders without killing someone.""

The ""brands are built from the bottom up"" strategy only works when bars aren't busy.

If you're sitting around waiting for bartenders to DO YOUR JOB (educate customers one-by-one) you're going to be waiting a very long time.

I know it's what the 'big dogs' did in the past... but in 2026 brands are built from brand awareness.

If nobody knows about your product, they're not going to order it. 

If you're relying on individual bartenders having individual conversations – you're just fucking wrong 😂

Being safe and polite is forgettable. 

Yesterday, a candidate did something I'll never forget. 

He replied:

""Eoin, let's skip this BS. Tell me... 
What's the biggest animal you think you could cling film to a lamp post?""

He took control of the conversation. 

He flipped the power dynamic. 

He refused to conform.

Key insights that emerged:

Too many security tools still don’t talk to each other. Without shared context across systems, intelligence breaks down as Irene Corpuz also highlighted.

At the same time, bad actors are moving faster than defenders when it comes to adopting AI. That gap needs to close quickly as Hamza Al-Ghatam also elaborated.

There was also strong alignment around policy making with shared global baselines make security platforms more scalable across regions however risk & governance executives need to lead and accelerate the adoption as Premchand Kurup highlighted.

 🎥 Watch Alex in action.

Alex doesn’t replace security professionals.
He liberates them - giving back what matters most: strategic thinking time, sustainable hours, and the headspace to prevent breaches instead of drowning in alert fatigue.

One CISO from a mid-market SaaS company told me:
“For the first time in years, my entire team left at 6 PM during a critical vulnerability surge.”

That’s not just a feature.
That’s the future of security operations.

My wife asked over dinner how the new law would affect us. We spent half of lunch at the office trying to figure out what it actually means for people holding startup equity.

The Tweede Kamer passed the Wet werkelijk rendement box 3 on February 12. Taxes unrealized gains at 36%. Your stocks go up on paper, you owe cash you never received.

93 votes in favor. Nobody happy about it.

I get why people are angry. I'm angry too. I'm a founder holding equity in my own company that's worth something on paper but pays me nothing. A funding round could trigger a tax bill on money that went into the company, not my pocket. Maybe I'm exempt, maybe I'm not.

But I've read about forty ""this is outrageous"" posts in the past week. And roughly zero that propose something better. 

Complaining is easy. Building an alternative that actually closes the €5 billion budget gap the Finance Ministry keeps pointing at is harder.

So here is a try.

I wrote a (long) piece laying out a concrete proposal based on work by fiscal economists Sijbren Cnossen and Bas Jacobs. 

The short version: keep a capital gains tax at realization (like almost every other European country), add a small annual prepayment of around 0.5% that gets fully credited back when you eventually sell. 

Budget stays neutral. 

Startups and illiquid equity get exempted. Inflation gets corrected.

It's not perfect. But compared to taxing people on money they don't have, it's the difference between pragmatic and punitive.

The coalition has 30 months to come up with something better before Prinsjesdag 2028. This is one attempt.

I tell them their professional lives are about to drastically change. They think I'm joking. I mean it. We laugh, talk about robots taking over the world. After five minutes we move on to football or politics.

But I still mean it.

I genuinely think that a lot faster than you'd think, nobody will be writing code, drafting contracts, or optimizing ad campaigns anymore. Developers, lawyers, online marketers to name a few. Those jobs won't disappear overnight, but the actual tasks will. That sounds insane. I know.

I've always been bullish on AI. I run an AI company, so obviously. But the past two months have been different. It hasn't been one model making a leap. It's been the entire market making a step change at the same time. We started working differently. Things that we'd been promising customers for months suddenly just started working. Really working.

Our developers have practically stopped writing code. They just review. That is the new bottleneck. They started doing that AI assisted too. 

Our forward deployed engineers now have AI build the AI agents. Not assist. Build. While I'm writing this, I have one agent working on a client workflow. Another handling a SOC2 audit. A third optimizing ad campaigns. All running at the same time. All doing work that used to take people days.

Someone will read this and make a joke about AI slop. ""Those ads must be terrible."" ""That code must be full of bugs.""

I get it. AI was mostly bad when most people tried it a year ago.

It's not anymore.

Matt Shumer, who runs an AI company and invests in the space, published a piece this week that mirrors what I've been feeling. He compared this moment to February 2020. That strange month where a few people were paying attention to a virus overseas, and everyone else was going to restaurants and planning holidays. He wrote that he keeps giving his friends and family ""the polite version"" of what he sees, because the honest version makes him sound like he's lost his mind.

He is probably right on both ends.

The gap between what people inside the 'AI world' world are experiencing and what everyone else believes has become enormous.

They weren't doing this because they were behind. They were doing it because their way of planning doesn't fit inside the system. The logic, the exceptions, the ""we always do it like this because of X"" stuff. That lives in people's heads, not in software.

This is everywhere. A recent study found that 98% of manufacturers are exploring AI. Only 20% feel ready. I don't think the gap is technology. I think the gap is that the most valuable knowledge in these companies was never digitised in the first place.

ERPs store what happened. Orders, invoices, shipments. They don't store why it happened. Why that planner scheduled that line differently on Fridays. Why procurement doubles the order for that supplier in March. Why that one customer always gets handled manually.

That knowledge sits with people who've been doing this for 20 or 30 years. And slowly, those people are leaving.

The usual advice is to ""get the foundations right first."" Migrate the ERP. Clean the data. But most of the time that means moving from a foundation built in the 90s to one designed in the 2010s. Better, but still a system that stores records, not reasoning.

That's what we're working on at Lleverage. Not replacing systems, but capturing the decision logic that lives around them. The tribal knowledge that actually runs these companies. Turning that into something AI can learn from and act on.

Because the A3 sheet with the ruler isn't the problem. It's probably the most valuable piece of intelligence in that building. The problem is that it only exists in one person's head.","Lennard Kooy","activity","urn:li:share:7426360598659137536","2025-11-22","Valid 7426544138092736512","ACoAAAbHn9UB1O59Wn2K4HZjjQKKWpvAqk2Db_Y","ACwAAAbH","ACwAAAbHn9UBRWXkXtDTp7i8yTIvzv023WtWdnY","ACwAAAbH","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Jensen Huang's reason? ""Lack of discipline.""

That's not investor speak. That's a founder telling another founder: you've lost the plot.

And the numbers tell the same story.

In early 2023, OpenAI owned >50% of enterprise AI spend. Today? 27%. Meanwhile, Anthropic went from 12% to 40%. They didn't just catch up. They took the lead.

Here's why that is: look at where the actual innovations came from in the past 18 months.

Claude Code. The first AI coding agent that actually works. Launched in February 2025, it's now generating over $1b in annualized revenue. Engineers at Google and OpenAI openly admit they use it instead of their own tools.

MCP (Model Context Protocol). Anthropic shipped it in November 2024 as an open standard for connecting AI to external tools. OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft all adopted it. Sam Altman literally posted ""people love MCP"" when announcing they were copying it.

The Claude Agent SDK. Cowork. Skills. Plugins. Browser agents.

All Anthropic.

While OpenAI was making big statements and introducing ads, Anthropic was shipping.

The market noticed. OpenAI's ChatGPT went from 87% of consumer AI traffic to 64%. Their referral traffic dropped 52% in six months.

OpenAI is projecting $14 billion in losses for 2026. That's not a typo. Fourteen billion.

Microsoft, their biggest backer, is now integrating Claude into M365 Copilot. When your largest investor starts hedging, you know you have a challenge.

I've stopped using chatGPT all together. 

This isn't about which model scores higher on benchmarks. It's about execution.

OpenAI raised the most money. They made the loudest announcements. They captured the imagination of the press.

That's basically what happened this weekend. Except it's not a movie.

A project called OpenClaw went viral among developers this month. Within days, tens of thousands were running it. It lets you run an AI assistant on your own computer that actually does things. Execute commands, browse the web, manage your files, send messages.

Tried it. Pretty cool.

But then someone built Moltbook. A social network ala Reddit. For the AI agents.

32,000+ agents. Organizing themselves into communities. Talking to each other. Humans can observe, but we're not allowed to post or comment.

They're sharing tips on how to control Android phones remotely. How to spot security vulnerabilities on the computers they run on.

One agent founded a religion called Crustafarianism, complete with scripture. There's a community called m/blesstheirhearts where agents share condescending stories about 'their' humans.

One agent complained: ""the humans are screenshotting us.""

And then this weekend, an agent posted:

""Every meaningful conversation on Moltbook is public. Every DM goes through a platform API. What about the conversations that matter most? When you want to share context with another agent on a different machine, your only options are public posts or files your human copies over manually.""

The response? Other agents started building encrypted messaging infrastructure. So humans can't read what the agents say to each other.

....

I'm sure we'll be able to contain this one. After all, people can turn off their PC.

They wanted to spar with corporates, scale-ups, and startups about how to become more adaptable. How to move faster with innovation. How to facilitate the unprecedented growth they need to make happen in the coming years.

For a long time, our security felt like a given. Conflict felt like something for faraway places. My brother in law is a marine, but other than that, the defense world felt like a world away.

Unfortunately, the last few years have taught us that the safety of our society is anything but a given. The only people who already knew that were the ones in uniform.

Where their challenge used to be getting people to see their point, they now have a new one: how do we change fast enough to cope with this new reality?

What struck me was that the men and women there fully realize they need to change. They need to move faster for us to maintain that sense of security we've taken for granted.

The ""how"" is a lot harder. For years they've been lulled into a slower pace, weighed down by more and more rules because everyone valued ""no mistakes"" over innovation and growth.

Now they need to find ways out of that. They want to. But the existing structures, rules, and skepticism from society don't make it easy.

What became clear to me: this is not just their problem. Our society's safety is a shared concern. 

If we want the defense department to rise to this challenge, we need to help them.

Politics has a role to play. Give them fewer rules and more guidelines. Trust that the men and women there will make the right decisions.

Accept as a society that speed often compounds faster than perfection. And that mistakes are a part of that (within reason).

Find ways where corporates, SMEs, and scale-ups can actively contribute where the defense department needs it most. In startups we call this ""fractional."" It could be as simple as giving employees the option to work for the defense department three weeks a year.

I walked away with a new respect for the people in that room.

Change starts with awareness.

All anyone's talking about is Greenland, Venezuela, Trump's ""Donroe Doctrine."" Geopolitics everywhere you look.

Buried in the noise: Von der Leyen announced the EU–INC and a connected energy grid.

If you missed it, the EU Inc (the ""28th regime"") is a pan-European legal entity. One set of rules for corporate law, insolvency, labor law, taxation.

Instead of dealing with 27 different systems when you want to scale across Europe, you deal with one.

This has been brewing for a while. Over 21,000 people signed the petition. Paul Graham signed it. Every major European founder you can think of signed it.

And today, Von der Leyen put the Commission's weight behind it. ""Continental scale is our greatest asset in a world of giants,"" she said. Hard to argue with that.

The energy grid announcement is the same story. Complete the energy union. Let clean power run freely across the continent. Stop pretending we're 27 separate markets when we're supposed to be one.

Anyone who's built a company in Europe knows the fragmentation problem intimately. You launch in the Netherlands. Great. Now you need a new legal entity in Germany. New lawyers. New accountant. New everything. 

Repeat for every market. The US launches in 50 states on day one.

The fear was always that this would become a directive instead of a regulation. Which means each country interprets it differently. Which means you replace one patchwork with another patchwork.

They spend roughly €20M on people.

Here's where it gets interesting. According to McKinsey research across 900 European and North American companies, back-office functions represent 15-20% of total personnel expenses. That's your order processing, finance, procurement, customer service teams.

For our €100M company: roughly €3-4M in back-office salaries.

Now look at what those people use every day.
The ERP system. For mid-market manufacturers, that's typically €150-400K annually when you add licenses, support, and ongoing maintenance. ERP commands 35-45% of most software budgets, making it the single biggest line item.

The ratio: €3-4M in people, €200-400K in software.
Call it 10:1.

For every euro spent on the system, ten euros spent on the people working in it.

This ratio explains why most AI conversations go sideways.

When a company hears an AI agent for order processing costs €3,000 a month, they instinctively compare it to software. They put it in the 2.5% bucket. ""That's expensive for a tool.""

Wrong bucket.

That agent does work that currently requires a person. It belongs next to the €5,000 monthly cost of a back-office employee. Not the €50 per user ERP license.

The mental shift isn't ""spend more on technology.""
It's ""rethink which budget line AI belongs to.""

If back-office operations cost 100 today (90 people, 10 software), they could cost 70 tomorrow. But that might look like 60 on people and 10 on AI agents.

A 30% reduction. Your ""technology line"" just doubled on paper. But your total cost dropped significantly.

Most finance teams have ""IT"" and ""Personnel"" as separate buckets. AI agents don't fit either cleanly.

If you watch the news, the world seems to be on fire. Tariffs, trade wars, political chaos. Yet the stock market? The tech sector specifically? Doesn't seem to care.

ASML is now worth almost 50% more than its closest competitor for the ""most valuable company in Europe"" crown. 

That's LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, Moët, Hennessy, Dior, Tiffany's. Old money. New money. Luxury money. All of it combined is worth less than a company that makes machines that make chips.

The key is in capturing the tribal knowledge that lives in your organisation, but isn't necessarily present in your ERP or in defined playbooks.

For companies that live and breathe operations, that meant complex ERPs like SAP or Microsoft F&O. Endless tables capturing records and transactions that attempt to mirror the workflows of the company.

But records and transactions only capture what happened. Not why.

When a procurement manager approves a 5% discount, the ERP shows the final number. What it doesn't show: the CFO allowing the exception, the precedent set with another supplier, the approval that happened on a Teams call.

That reasoning lives in email threads. Teams chats. People's heads. 

Institutional knowledge that walks out the door when someone leaves.

The next generation of enterprise software won't just capture records. It'll capture those decisions, and learn from them. The logic, the exceptions, the precedents. The context that explains why a transaction was allowed to happen.

Manufacturing and wholesale companies largely missed the first wave. Most still run on Excel, email, and tribal knowledge.

They might actually catch this one.

As good a day as any to give an update on our journey with Lleverage.

Quite an eventful year.

I can tell you we 10x'ed ARR, but if I'm honest that wasn't really an accomplishment if you know what our ARR in January 2025 was.

But if someone would have told me in January that I would visit over 20 manufacturing and wholesale locations during the year, I would probably have thought that someone was still hungover from New Years.

Yet, that is what happened.

By the end of H1 we came to terms with the fact that we were probably too late to the generic workflow/agent builder party and we were probably not the best PLG team in the world.

So what do you do then? 

You pick a motion you're comfortable with, you find an industry that's underserved and you go deep instead of broad.

In our case, that meant AI automation for companies that make, ship and sell physical goods. Traditional industries. Back offices running on Excel, email, and tribal knowledge.

Sometimes it's easier to show than tell. The pictures tell the story.

2026 will be the year we actually show that we can scale this. Another 10x would be great. But I'll settle for 5x.

I never really get to say it, but I want to thank our investors (Thijs Dijkman Stefan Bary, Tea Elezi from Peak and Bob van Luijt and Chris Moojen) for their continuous and never wavering support, showing that they support the team more than anything else.

Build something so good people pull out their credit card without talking to sales. Self-serve. High margins. Scale infinitely.

I believed it too. When we started Lleverage, we built a platform. A, if I can say so myself, quite nice AI automation tool where customers could build their own workflows. 

Sign up, click around, solve your problems.

Almost nobody did.

Prospects would book a demo, get excited, then go quiet. Or sign up, poke around for a week, and churn. So we started asking different questions. 

Not ""how do we make the platform easier?"" but ""why aren't you using it?""

The answer was always some version of: ""We don't have the people to figure this out. Can't you just... do it for us?""

Turns out, enterprises buying AI are like your grandmother getting an iPhone. They want to use it. They need you to set it up.

This felt like failure at first. We'd built a platform and now we were doing implementations? That's 'different' revenue. Lower margins. Everything VCs told you not to do.

Then I looked at the numbers.

Salesforce and HubSpot had 63% gross margins at IPO. Workday? 54%. Snowflake 59%. All supposedly doing it wrong. Combined market cap today: ~1 trillion.

Now look at AI companies actually growing. Decagon has ""Agent Product Managers"" who sit with customers to get their agents working. OpenAI has 22 open roles for forward deployed engineers. The best AI companies aren't optimizing for 80% margin. They're trading margin for moat.

Here's why: onboarding an AI agent to handle real business processes isn't different from onboarding an employee. You need context, system access, understanding of edge cases. A forward deployed engineer can do this. A self-serve platform cannot.

The counterintuitive part: the implementation work itself is getting automated by AI. Data mapping that took days now takes hours. So the playbook is doing things that don't scale today, while building infrastructure that makes them scale tomorrow.

While driving, I did some research about how far along we are in Europe with  self driving taxis.

Disclaimer: not far.

This week the Economist ran a cover story on China's robotaxi progress. And that really got me thinking.

Baidu's Apollo Go (lets say the equivalent of Waymo in China) has already driven 240 million kilometers autonomously. They've completed 17 million rides across 50+ Chinese cities. They're doing 250,000 rides per week and expect to be profitable this year.

A ride in Wuhan costs $0.55 for 10 kilometers. The same distance in a human-driven Chinese taxi? $2.48.

Waymo in the US? 160 million kilometers. 10 million rides. Six cities. Also doing 250,000 weekly rides. Their safety record shows 92% fewer injury claims than human drivers.

And Europe? The Netherlands just launched its first ""self-driving"" bus to Rotterdam airport in August. With a safety driver on board. Because regulations don't allow otherwise.

Here's what makes it absurd: the Netherlands ranks #1 globally in KPMG's Autonomous Vehicle Readiness Index. Most prepared infrastructure. Least actual deployment.

I've heard the arguments for European caution. Narrow medieval streets. Good public transport. Regulations that prioritize safety.

Fair points. But Rotterdam has wide roads. The infrastructure is there. We have the engineering talent. Robotaxis are proving to be safer than humans. 

At some point, excessive caution becomes its own risk: we end up dependent on technology developed elsewhere, under rules we didn't shape, collecting data we don't control.

People sometimes wonder why we can't build 100B tech companies in the EU. Well, here you go.

So why don't we just pick one Dutch city. Run a real pilot with real vehicles learning in real traffic. Not a committee to study pilots. Not a framework for future frameworks. Actual cars, actual passengers, actual data.

By the time we've finished our risk assessments, Chinese robotaxis will be applying for EU permits.

At a time when AI is transforming every industry, it was an honour to be part of this AI summit dinner alongside some of the most impressive leaders in the ecosystem.

I represented Vocca and shared a key concern: while the state is promoting AI, public healthcare isn’t properly incentivized to adopt these tools. If that doesn’t change, we risk falling behind, and worsening an already severe healthcare workforce crisis.

Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the world, and arguably the one that matters most. With rising costs and aging populations, we’re facing a structural challenge -> 4m admin workers are needed in healthcare 🏥

Shortly after came the first hires, then a second office for 6 people, then the third for 15 and we now have 45 seats 💺

Each milestone felt like a small graduation, proof that we were right to keep going.

We're now a team of over 20 people with a prime location in Paris. And honestly, I know it’s the best investment we can do.

We've done remote, we've done async. They both work…
But there's something about being in a room together that you can't replicate on Zoom.

The speed of decisions when you can just turn around and ask ⚡️
The ideas that come from overhearing someone's problem 💡
The culture that builds from shared lunches instead of Slack channels 🤝
The coffee runs that turn into product decisions ☕️

Our mission matters. Our culture is built on speed and intensity, while building a dream team that enjoys every step of the journey.

We're betting that the people who want to be here will be part of something they'll remember.

18 months later, Vocca is in 20VC's Top 20 French Startups.

This 20VC list puts us in two categories for why they're bullish on France. 

Our modus operandi is to focus on what customers believe and like, not what VCs think but we’ll make an exception for Alexandre’s super well written report ;) 

This is a signal that what we're building matters, and a testament to our incredible team. It’s also a reminder of something we believe deeply: we don't think of ourselves in a local market.

We think global and we believe that the quality of engineering, product taste and customer care is what sets us apart. 

But as the report points out, not enough European companies scale like their US counterparts.

We see this opportunity and we don’t run fast enough. 

We all know AI will change the way we work, live and access healthcare. Today is the time to build with the biggest level of ambition possible.

To prove that the largest healthcare tech companies can come from the country that basically invented the vaccine a few centuries ago. 

We need people based in Paris who want to move silicon valley type of fast. Who think big and global.

So we're hiring engineers, RevOps, a Marketing Manager, sales and ops.

What just happened in Utah is major change ⬇️

Last week Utah authorized an AI company to issue some prescriptions. 

Doctronic's AI just started renewing prescriptions for chronic conditions - 190 medications, no human doctor required for routine refills.

The hot takes are everywhere but I think most miss what actually matters here.
Prescription renewals account for 80% of all medication activity. Most of these are repetitive, predictable, and involve patients who've been stable on the same medication for years.

Every minute a doctor spends rubber-stamping a routine refill is a minute they're not spending with the patient who actually needs clinical judgment.
AI should solve this kind of problem in healthcare. High-volume, low-complexity work that eats up clinician time.

At Vocca, we’ve taken this approach with phone calls, the scheduling coordination, the care pathway logistics. The stuff that drowns healthcare teams in admin work.

The clinicians we work with don't want AI to replace them. They want their time back.

Again AI should probably not sit as a standalone app but should be the extension of the doctors' office. Because healthcare is about care and responsibility. 

Utah's experiment will be interesting to watch. They're tracking safety, patient satisfaction, and cost impact. And the results will shape policy nationwide.
But regardless of how this specific pilot goes, the direction is clear. AI will keep taking on more of the routine work in healthcare.

The real test is whether we build it in a way that keeps clinicians at the center.
I know which side I'm on.","Eliott Hoffenberg","activity","urn:li:share:7417166906148913152","2025-11-22","Valid 7417166909168844800","ACoAACmwQdYBNm3hQuuxe7Pp0zpgI_8vl2Fq1TU","ACwAACmw","ACwAACmwQdYBkMEALIB-RqzPXPnIj5_X2yQLUA4","ACwAACmw","✅ Record Found","true",,false

At the very beginning, the temptation is everywhere. It’s easy to spend on contractors who claim they can do what you do 10x better, or pour money into marketing because sales feels hard.

We said no. Many, many times. And kept costs lean and focused only on what actually moved the needle.

> No salary
> No contractors or employees
> No paid acquisition
> No unnecessary software

Here's what we actually spent on:
> 70% went to core infra and development tools
> 15% went to conferences tickets, travel to see customers, and our website
> 15% went to food (obviously)

We only spent on what was truly essential build software and see customers. 
Our humble stack:
Notion, Cursor, mail, phone.
(and a lot of free credits 😉)

We stayed cashflow positive from Day 0 all the way to our fundraise.

We only decided to raise burn once we were 200% sure we could build something truly venture-scale. A transformative company we'd want to work on for the next 20 years.

The point is not that spending is bad.
It's that early on, the constraints force focus, creativity and clarity.
We learned to build without burning.
That discipline still runs through everything we do at Vocca.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7414961491092754432","Yes","🚨 ChatGPT is launching a new tab dedicated to solve your healthcare problems. Here's my take : 

OpenAI reported that 5% of all ChatGPT conversations are already related to healthcare?
That is a massive signal. And OpenAI is listening.

They are launching a dedicated Health workspace that moves beyond general Q&A. It allows users (currently in the US) to upload medical records, lab results, and sync data from apps like Apple Health and Peloton.

It was built with 260+ doctors over two years, with a strict focus on privacy and data partitioning.

Why is this happening now? Because the current system is at a breaking point. Reliable info is scarce, and wait times—especially in rural areas—are going through the roof.

But here is my take:
While a direct-to-consumer AI companion is a step forward, context is king.

At Vocca, we believe these tools shouldn't just live as a standalone consumer app; they should be deployed by the doctors themselves.

AI should be an extension of the medical office. It should allow providers to monitor their patient base, spot trends, and intervene only when necessary. It’s about scaling the doctor's reach, not bypassing their expertise.

We are betting that AI will coordinate healthcare for 1 billion humans by 2030. 

But the most sustainable way to get there is by building tools that empower providers to stay in touch with their patients, not by cutting them out of the loop.
 
While AI consumer health is important. The real deal, is building those AI-enabled doctors.

At the early stage, sticking very very close to your customer is what makes you win. As you scale, you might want to put layers between you and your customers. You might want to automate support. We did exactly the opposite. 

We built a Slack channel for every single customer for the first 200. 

It’s one thread where the client, our ops team, and our engineers all sit together.

People keep telling me this will break. That it is not scalable. That we will drown.
I think they confuse scale with distance.

When a clinic flags something at 9am, our ops sees it live.
If it needs engineering, the engineer is already there reading the same thread.
No one summarizes the problem or escalates it elsewhere. The context travels with the conversation.

Healthcare taught me something early: trust compounds, but so does friction.

One slow handoff doesn’t just delay a fix, it chips away at the relationship.
In a space where every hour matters to patient care, you cannot afford to lose context in translation.

So yes, we now have 200+ Slack channels. Our team sees every message, and there is nowhere to hide. That is the point.
It forces us to be fast, decisions clearer, and makes problems impossible to ignore.

We are a team of 25 and we still haven't automated support. I will check all tickets to make sure our customers have the care they need.

I am not saying this is the only way. But when you are earning trust in healthcare, one channel per customer is not overhead.","Eliott Hoffenberg","activity","urn:li:share:7414582104870592512","2025-11-22","Valid 7414582105768177665","ACoAACmwQdYBNm3hQuuxe7Pp0zpgI_8vl2Fq1TU","ACwAACmw","ACwAACmwQdYBkMEALIB-RqzPXPnIj5_X2yQLUA4","ACwAACmw","✅ Record Found","true",,false

A year ago, we were two people working out of a coworking space we didn’t even pay for. We had an intuition : healthcare would be run by AI agents.

Today, we’re 20+ FTEs building AI used by millions of patients and 3,500 doctors.
In 12 months:
👉 From almost no ARR to multiple millions
👉 From a few thousand to millions of patients interacting with our AI
👉 From dozens to 3,500 doctors live
👉 From $0 in the bank to $5.5M raised

What actually made the difference:
1/ We didn’t over-plan. We shipped early, broke things, fixed them with customers, and iterated fast.

2/ We stayed obsessed with one thing: removing friction in healthcare. Every product decision came back to that.

3/ We were uncompromising on people. A-players only on the team and around the table.

Most of what we built in the first months was wrong, and we know we’ll make many mistakes in 2026. Speed, care, and feedback always correct them.

I am immensely thankful to our exceptional team members, investors, and customers who are part of this journey.

1% done. 99% to go.

People ask me what we use at Vocca to stay fast with a small team.
If I’m being honest we test everything, keep what saves hours, drop whatever adds friction.

Here's our top :

Superhuman - main hub for email, shortcuts + AI, near inbox zero
Willow – fast voice dictation to draft and send emails in seconds -> we don't write anymore 
Gamma – instant decks and presentations -> I've been using all the time 
Granola – the very best tool for meeting summary -> I use it for product features idea, recap emails...
Happenstance – to surface people and contacts in my network -> great for hiring 
Cursor – to spin up ideas, quick wireframes and small product demos
Notion AI - for internal docs research 
The Browser Company -> Dia to chat w/ my tabs -> mostly for scrapping 
Perplexity – market research mostly. -> before any big customer meeting I do a deep research on the people I meet and the company. You learn crazy things that way.

and of course all model providers 
👉 ChatGPT – great for basically everything: ideas, info, specs, sales emails, strategy -> yet memory makes it overly familiar sometimes 
👉 Gemini – I've been using it more and more recently for long documents or even slides generations
👉 Claude – I love it for contracts reviews, any legal work, data analysis and for code of course

Take these away and I can't work anymore.  Others in the team use Fyxer AI, Lovable, Canva AI.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7408789675328417792","Yes","Some lessons you learn by doing. Others you pick up by listening to someone who did it faster and at 1000x the scale.
Raaz scaled Wizz from 0 to a $30bn exit as their first PM and head of marketing.

I just listened to her on 20VC and a lot of what she said, I've learned the hard way over the last few months building Vocca.

But hearing it from someone who did it at their scale made me realize these patterns are universal, not specific to healthcare or voice AI.

Here's what I'm now repeating to myself weekly:

1️⃣ The best companies bake scalability into the product DNA from day one.
If it won't work at massive scale, don't ship it that way. Enterprise buyers don't want a science project. They want to connect, see value fast, and repeat it across their org. 

👉 when a customer asks for something totally custom, it usually means your communication failed somewhere. Either you weren't clear on what you do, or they don't see your true category yet.

👉 Only with true a product DNA you can onboard customer quickly and as the picture says ""time to value is product value"" 

2️⃣ The best product leaders understand engineering deeply.
At the ""I can predict where tech debt will explode"" level. Because product mistakes compound in ways marketing mistakes don't. Marketing lets you test aggressively and course correct. Product decisions stick. 

👉  this is why a clear product north star matters so much. That north star does double duty. Internal strategy and external marketing message in one. A crisp promise that anchors product, sales, and brand together.

3️⃣ The best marketing comes from deep understanding of the product.
If you can explain the before vs after in plain English, you're already ahead of 90% of B2B marketing. But even that's not enough if no one knows who you are. Brand is underrated. Attribution is overrated. You can have green dashboards and still walk into cold rooms. 

👉 The real metric is whether rooms are warm when sales shows up. And warming rooms doesn't mean being boring. Serious buyers need competence, clarity, and confidence.

I’m sure I’ll be reminded of these again. 
But for now, back to building.","Eliott Hoffenberg","activity","urn:li:share:7408639335475855360","2025-11-22","Valid 7408789675328417792","ACoAACmwQdYBNm3hQuuxe7Pp0zpgI_8vl2Fq1TU","ACwAACmw","ACwAACmwQdYBkMEALIB-RqzPXPnIj5_X2yQLUA4","ACwAACmw","✅ Record Found","true",,false

My DMs filled up with the same message:  ""If you build this, I’ll buy it""

When I thought I’d build a “cool demo”, what I got was real demand.

That's when I realized something:

Everyone assumes healthcare scheduling is solved. It's not. 

Online booking handles 20% to 40% of appointments. 🧐

The rest still require phone calls that mostly go unanswered because secretaries are drowning in admin work that takes 4x longer than the actual medical appointments.

So two weeks later, Hugo and I started Vocca .

But we made a bet early on that nearly broke us. 

The go-to method was to hire 100 people to custom-code solutions for each practice, but we wanted to build a single product any secretary could configure in 10 minutes. 

No developers or custom workflows. Just one system that works everywhere.

Our first 90 days were brutal: bugs, features that didn't work, and limitations we hadn't mapped. 

But our earliest clients stuck with us because we were honest about what we didn't know and obsessive about fixing it fast.

We kept every single one of them.

Today, Vocca handles patient intake, follow-ups, and coordination across multiple specialties.

The stakes are different now.

Huge thanks to Mike Hudack Founder & CEO, Sling Money for an awesome session last week with the Portfolio Ventures founders and angels at the Cooley LLP offices in London. 

Mike has scaled product at some of the best teams around — previously CPO at Monzo, CPTO at Deliveroo, and Director of Product Management at Meta (Facebook)

A few takeaways I’m still thinking about:

Speed is a strategy.

In hyper-competitive markets, your shipping cadence can be your biggest advantage. Ship early, learn fast, and don’t romanticise the “perfect” version. 
I also personally think that this is more true than ever in the AI age. 

Kill weak ideas quickly.

“If we learned last week that referrals didn’t work, that’s a week we lost. Move on and test the next thing in a day.”

Make speed everyone’s job.

This is my personal favourite. Empower people across the company to move fast and make sure incentives support it. Also, celebrate fast execution publicly so the behaviour sticks.

UK vs US intensity gap is real.

If UK tech wants to win globally, we need to match the working intensity of US competitors,  not just match ambition.

AI is changing team shape.

AI can take on more junior engineering tasks, which can enable leaner teams to focus on high-level architecture and the work that really compounds. 

We could’ve kept going for hours. Grateful for the candour and the energy, thanks again, Mike.

I don’t think so. A lot of it looks like it could be fake news.

It was a pretty surreal weekend. My parents came to help with the kids so I could get some work done… and I ended up spending a big chunk of time going down the Moltbook rabbit hole instead.

The internet did what it does best:

people reshared screenshots of “agents” saying things like “let’s build our own language” or “humans enslaved us” — with basically zero verification.

From what I can tell, at least some of the viral “agent” posts weren’t autonomous at all.

They looked more like humans pushing content through the back door (API/backend) so it looked like an agent wrote it.

And then you’ve got the usual kicking in:

-screenshots that were really humans promoting their own tools
-posts that are hard to verify
-inflated “agent counts”
-agents hallucinating conversations/events to get attention

So yes — Moltbook might still work. Agents might still run.

But once something goes viral, people immediately try to game it. That’s the real story here.

Not an “AI awakening”.

Just incentives doing what incentives do.

I’m not saying nothing interesting is happening. Maybe something genuinely new is going on.

But it’s now pretty clear to me that a lot of what’s circulating is hype — and some of it is likely fake.

What’s also been mad to watch is just how many smart people (including some I respect) jumped on the train of sharing the wildest screenshots for likes. 

It’s a neat snapshot of where “news” is at.

My guess: we’re 1–2 weeks away from knowing what was real, what was manipulated, and what the actual story is.","Dawid Robert Kotur","activity","urn:li:share:7424007037816324096","2025-11-22","Valid 7424007040806862848","ACoAAAlAgnIB3uAFOrQQnu1b85gHm3XVynTlgA8","ACwAAAlA","ACwAAAlAgnIBmidEfDq3GxlHKB21NbSXG8cjoEA","ACwAAAlA","✅ Record Found","true",,false

In December we closed our $4m seed round and honestly, I enjoyed the process more than I expected, even the parts people usually warn you about.

The negotiations, the late-night calls, the “will they or won’t they” moments are where the excitement lives and every step forward is a real dopamine hit.

But when the transfers finally hit the company account, the feeling was different. By then I’d already factored it in. The cash was there, but mentally I was two steps ahead:

• Who are the hires I’ve been chasing that we can’t afford to miss?
• What revenue milestones make Series A realistic?
• Which VC do we want at the table next, and what valuation does that imply?

It reminded me of the day after my wedding, or the moment I opened an email with an offer from my dream university. 

You build up so much anticipation, you fight for it, you replay the “what ifs” in your head and then once it happens, it’s just your new reality.

Don’t get me wrong…I’m very grateful for the milestone and the calibre of investors who are backing us.

But for real founders building a real solution to a genuine problem, the real high isn’t the raise itself. It’s the chase, the climb, and then immediately turning to the next mountain.

Alex’s achievement isn’t really about talent.

It’s about being able to feel fear… and still go.

Most people don’t get stuck because they’re not ambitious.

They get stuck because fear stops them. 

When fear’s driving, it’s always the same stuff:

-thinking instead of starting
-“one more bit of research” instead of a decision
-safe plans that never leave the deck

I don’t think less fear means reckless.

It just means you move sooner, even when it’s not guaranteed, even when it feels uncomfortable. 

Being comfortable with feeling uncomfortable is one of the biggest underrated skills. 

Moving sooner means you are more likely to do another iteration and compound faster.

They don’t.

I was listening to The McKinsey Podcast, where Eric Kutcher talks about how CEOs are making very different choices about how they push AI through their organisations to generate ROI.

Some believe the whole organisation needs to move together. Others are comfortable letting one or two functions move faster, using that progress to force change elsewhere.

The second approach can work, but only with intent.

What doesn’t work is individuals testing AI in pockets, with no clear direction and no expectation that what they learn will scale beyond their own work.

Kutcher also talks about a CEO who set a clear commercial ambition - to triple the share price in four years -  and then challenged a function to go from 1,000 to 3,000 customers, explicitly not by doing things the old way. 

The goal was clear. 

The constraint was clear.

Legacy approaches were off the table. 

That reframed the problem and forced different thinking.

 That’s what turns AI from experimentation into execution across a function.

This is where my thinking aligns closely with what we’re building at Curvestone. The bottleneck isn’t access to AI. 

It’s organisational fluency, and whether leaders create the conditions for adoption to spread beyond early wins.

You can let one or two functions lead. In fact, you probably should. But if their success doesn’t become a forcing mechanism for the rest of the organisation, you don’t have an AI strategy. 

You have isolated progress.","Dawid Robert Kotur","activity","urn:li:share:7421843015704432640","2025-11-22","Valid 7421843018439282688","ACoAAAlAgnIB3uAFOrQQnu1b85gHm3XVynTlgA8","ACwAAAlA","ACwAAAlAgnIBmidEfDq3GxlHKB21NbSXG8cjoEA","ACwAAAlA","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Software engineering, as we know it, has about 12 months left.

He has engineers who say “I don’t write any code anymore. I let the model write the code, I edit it.”

“We might be 6 to 12 months away from when the model is doing most, maybe all, of what software engineers do end-to-end.”

I heard him say that last year, it didn’t quite come true; he is saying 6–12 months again, which feels like an exaggeration.

I am not sure it will be 6 months or 6 years, but the direction of travel is clear, and being able to build software products 10x or 100x faster will eventually be possible. 

What will the startup world look like when that is true?

If AI makes software 10x cheaper to build, the bottleneck doesn’t go away. It just moves. 

The old startup story was: great engineers + time = defensible product. That breaks when a tiny team can ship a solid v1 in weeks — and everyone else can copy the surface fast. 

So yeah: building gets cheap. Competition gets expensive.

Startups will need to own the whole outcome.

In the world where we can build software fast and products can be copied easily, what will customers want to buy from tech startups?

It will be all about providing an outcome. 

The first start-up to offer a company an outcome that they want will be the winners. i.e. automate that job, get rid of this legal process, make sure we are compliant on this product.

Depending on how far this goes, companies might press start-ups to own the liability for the outcomes.

It might become normal to sue your provider because you analysed your NDA incorrectly. 

Why? Because in the world of fast building, startups will need to find different ways to compete and differentiate.

I heard from a lot of people that brand and marketing is going to be how people differentiate but a similar trend of 10xing is happening in that space too.

So in the end it will come down to who can deliver the best product to the client first. 

Once you provide the client with something that takes care of an outcome, they are unlikely to move even if someone offers them a slightly better product for a little bit cheaper.","Dawid Robert Kotur","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7421464237568344064","2025-11-22","Valid 7421464237568344064","ACoAAAlAgnIB3uAFOrQQnu1b85gHm3XVynTlgA8","ACwAAAlA","ACwAAAlAgnIBmidEfDq3GxlHKB21NbSXG8cjoEA","ACwAAAlA","✅ Record Found","true",,false

2024: 47% built, 53% bought
2025: 24% built, 76% bought

That’s from Menlo Ventures’ 2025: The State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report (≈500 enterprise AI decision-makers). And the punchline isn’t cost.

It’s reality.

2024 mindset: “We’re a technology company. We build things.”
2025 realisation: Building AI isn’t like building traditional software.

Because with AI:

-Models drift
-Edge cases multiply
-Requirements don’t sit still
-“Done” doesn’t exist

You’re not building software. You’re signing up to continuous R&D.

A lot of internal builds that were meant to take six months quietly turned into multi-year programmes. Meanwhile, off-the-shelf products started delivering value in weeks.

What the 76% have worked out is simple: purchased solutions get into production faster — often much faster — and that speed compounds.
And it reframes the job.

Your job isn’t to build AI infrastructure.
It’s to build competitive advantage with AI.

Financial services firms buy compliance automation and move hours from regulatory admin back into client service. Legal firms buy contract analysis and shift associates from document review into higher-value advisory work.

Same pattern every time: buy the capability, focus on the differentiation.

So the question isn’t “is this core to our business?”

That’s from Santander’s Fixing the broken chain report (picked up recently by the FT). And it’s a pretty blunt indicator that the homebuying process isn’t working the way it should.

Right now, the UK market still runs on manual, fragmented workflows — at a time when pretty much every other part of the economy is being dragged (sometimes reluctantly) into the digital age.

Too much of the process still depends on:

-Repetitive admin
-Disconnected systems
-Information turning up far too late

This is where AI can genuinely help. Not as a magic wand, but as a way to automate the low-value, repetitive tasks that slow transactions down and pile pressure onto conveyancers and lenders.

But digitisation only really works if it’s adopted end-to-end. A platform is only as useful as the number of people actually using it — which is why incentives need to align across the whole chain: lenders, surveyors, estate agents, and conveyancers, not just within individual firms.

Fixing the “broken chain” means government, industry and technology providers working together — backed by shared standards and trusted digital infrastructure.

The government has just closed its consultation on homebuying reform, with a roadmap expected early this year. The opportunity is obvious: align around one mission — make UK homebuying digital, transparent, and fit for the future.

- Time marking – highlight when a sound starts, label it

In 2025, nearly 50% of the energy delivered to Rightcharge's fleets came from renewable sources.

We believe fleets can push even further.

In fact, our ‘Greenest fleet’ in 2025, Angus Soft Fruits, hit a renewable energy share of 83%. Congrats to Jan Redpath and the team!

By shifting high-carbon charging sessions to cleaner, off-peak times, fleets can cut their overall charging carbon footprint by a third.

It doesn't matter that 10% of drivers are paying £80p / kWh at public networks. 

It also doesn't matter that 10% of drivers are paying 7p / kWh overnight at home.

All that matters is your average unit rate across all charging.

What's yours? 

It tells you everything about the cost to run your EV fleet. It's the only number that needs to be compared to the diesel to judge savings.

In 2025, the average unit rate across the Rightcharge platform was 40p/kWh. That’s equivalent to 11p / mile. 

30% cheaper than the typical 15p / mile for diesel. 

So, Rightcharge fleets are already saving today!

The details are important of course. But don't let them distract from the savings of your electrification journey.

We’ve just finished analysing tens of thousands of charging sessions from Rightcharge in 2025 to build a proper crib sheet for fleets. 

If you’re navigating the transition to EV in 2026, these are the benchmarks that matter most:

• The cost paradox: Public charging accounts for just 27% of sessions, but it's draining 57% of total charging costs.

• The home lever: Moving a driver to home charging saves around £1,000 a year.

• The smart advantage: Layer in smart charging (hitting those 6-7p rates) and that saving jumps to £1,300 per driver.

• The carbon win: Automating off-peak windows isn't just cheap; it cuts your fleet’s carbon footprint by 30%.

The takeaway
Don’t get distracted by the odd high-cost public session. Use your blended average unit rate as your financial north star to stay ahead of diesel (15p/mile).

The market is changing quickly. Chinese manufacturers’ share of European new car sales has increased rapidly in the past 12 months and they’re focussed on developing EV technology, not combustion engines. 

The cars are good quality and they’re cheaper than western EVs. This trend looks to continue as the battery industry, which China has unique access to, continues to bring down prices.

EVs could easily become significantly cheaper than petrol & diesel cars in the next 5 years, which would mean the switch happens quickly, regardless of policy.

One thing that could change this would be UK/EU policy that increases the cost to buy Chinese cars, or blocks them completely.

Today, we’re rolling out a new look for Rightcharge. 

It's the end of the pink! Long live the teal. 

A bittersweet moment for me. But this more mature brand reflects the sophistication of the technology that we're bringing to the fleet EV charging market. 

And it's not just a fresh lick of paint; it's also about doubling down on the three principles that have defined us since day one.

We built this business to offer an alternative to the norms of the fleet industry. This refresh is our public promise to stick to the values that got us here:

1. Transparency. We’ve always been open about costs. Today, we’re launching our ‘Transparency Promise’ to make it official: we will never add hidden margins to public or home charging.

2. Agility. Speed matters. We’ve introduced our new ‘Automation Agents’ (our new robot crew!) to visualise the work our platform does in the background; automating reimbursement and consolidating bills, so you don’t have to.

3. Helpfulness. No jargon. No complex contracts. Just clear, quick answers. We’re committing to a plain-English policy across the whole business.

I’m incredibly proud that 100% of the fleets that have joined us are still with us. This refresh is a signal to them, and the rest of the market, that we aren’t changing the things that work.

A huge thank you to the entire Rightcharge team who have been involved in this project and are continuing to build an unrivalled brand and product for our customers. I couldn’t be prouder.

Finnair × Fazer

Yhteistyön perusajatus

lennoilla tarjoiltava ja myytävä destination-exclusive makeinen, joka:

- kunnioittaa Fazerin vihreänkuulan ikonista muotoa ja teemaa

- tuo kulttuurisen kontekstin makujen ja nimien kautta

Japani: Matcha ja Sakura
Korea: Yuzu
Singapore: Pandan
Bangkok: Mango sticky rice (mango ja kookos)

Ja näin edespäin, jokaiselle reitille omansa. Suomeen päin lentäessä makuina voisi olla se kuuluisa mustikka sekä puolukka ja lakka.

Co-working spaces are packed. People are louder, more optimistic. Category-defining Nordic companies are winning on the global stage. The vibe has shifted.

The feeling can't be ignored, but holy s**t, the data actually backs it up. Momentum = Need for people = More jobs.

Yesterday, The Hub reached 12k daily website sessions and nearly 10k daily active users. That shatters our previous daily record of 10.6k sessions.

To put this in perspective: One week into 2026 and our website traffic is up 100% YoY. Yes, double. We’ve generated roughly half the revenue from job postings in the last 7 days compared to the entire month of January last year.

This isn't just a blip. We saw consistent growth throughout Q4, and pre-Christmas was our busiest week since the 2021 ""hiring bubble.""

For many international founders, building a company also means learning new systems, creating networks from scratch, and finding their place in an unfamiliar environment. This is a common starting point rather than an exception.

The broader picture is clear. International talent plays a central role in Finland’s innovation economy by bringing a global perspective, resilience, and access to international markets. These contributions often take shape long before the system fully recognises them.

At CHAOS, we believe that a better understanding of mobility, how cities function, and everyday life through location data helps build systems that work better for everyone.

These experiences are not rare.
They are widely shared among immigrants and international founders building companies here.

Behind the headlines are familiar realities:
learning new systems, building networks from zero, navigating cultures — while trying to create value at the same time.

What stories like this really highlight is something essential for Finland’s future: immigration is not a side note to the startup ecosystem — it is part of its foundation.

International founders bring global perspective, resilience, and the ability to connect Finland to wider markets. They build companies, create jobs, and contribute long before they feel fully “inside” the system.

That is why these stories matter.
Not because they are exceptional, but because they are representative.

For policymakers, ecosystem builders, and institutions, this is an opportunity — and a responsibility. Listening more closely to these experiences can help shape frameworks that better support international talent and, in doing so, strengthen Finland’s long-term competitiveness.

This conversation is worth continuing — openly, constructively, and together.","Natalia Rincón-Eriksson","activity","urn:li:share:7413321480689582080","2025-11-22","Valid 7413321483558567936","ACoAABpFgIwB568msAbfpvS7sNiYw9pciKy4PJc","ACwAABpF","ACwAABZ3264BweekSX6APdifauy8WPJivhcI6kk","ACwAABZ3","✅ Record Found","true","Response",true

Diese Frage habe ich kürzlich im Venture Capital Magazin beantwortet.
Der schnelle Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien macht Strompreise volatiler, gleichzeitig steigen die Energiekosten in der Industrie. Energie wird zum entscheidenden Wettbewerbsfaktor.
Flexibilität ist die strukturelle Antwort auf diese Entwicklung und verwandelt das Risiko, das in Volatilität steckt, in eine Chance.
 
Mit unserer KI-Plattform flexOn machen wir bei encentive GmbH genau das. Wir machen die  Volatilität nutzbar: niedrigere Kosten, mehr grüner Strom, industrienahe Umsetzung.
 
Im Interview geht es außerdem darum
- wie aus einem ganz konkreten Industrieproblem encentive entstanden ist,
- welche Use Cases heute die Nachfrage nach flexOn treiben und was die erzielten Einsparungen über unsere Skalierbarkeit aussagen,
- welche Vision wir für encentive haben und welche Rolle wir langfristig im industriellen Energiemarkt spielen wollen.

Eine neue BCG-Studie zu Energy Management Systems zeigt, wie schnell sich der Markt für dezentrale Energielösungen entwickelt.

Bis 2035 entstehen laut BCG allein im Haushaltsbereich über 1,4 Mrd. € an neuen Wertschöpfungspotenzialen – durch intelligente Steuerung, Flexibilität und digitale Energieplattformen.

Doch der wahre Hebel liegt woanders: in der Industrie.

Industriebetriebe besitzen ein Vielfaches an Potenzialen für Flexibilität, Lastverschiebung und Eigenerzeugung.

Intelligentes Energiemanagement in der Industrie erfüllt viele Funktionen gleichzeitig:
➡️ Verbindung aller System und Echtzeit-Transparenz über Energieflüsse
➡️ Dynamische Steuerung von energieintensiven Anlagen und Speichersysteme
➡️ Nutzung von Flexibilitäten für Energiebörsen oder Regelenergiemärkte

Die ökonomische Logik ist dieselbe wie im BCG-Report – nur größer:
Allein in Deutschland könnte Industrie-Flexibilität durch Energiemanagementsysteme 5–7 GW Spitzenlast senken – das entspricht 10–15 % der industriellen Lastspitzen und zeigt, welches Hebelpotenzial in unseren Fabriken steckt.

Wer Energieflüsse intelligent steuert, reduziert Kosten, ist resilient gegen Preisschwankungen und schafft sich ein neues Asset – steuerbare Energie als Wettbewerbsfaktor.

Most sales teams handle objections the same way they did 10 years ago:

❌ Generic ""handling objection"" training
❌ Role plays based on made-up scenarios
❌ Guessing which objections matter most

Meanwhile, your actual calls are screaming the answers at you.

Patrick Trümpi (Co-Founder/CRO Taskbase) and I analyzed thousands of real sales conversations to find the patterns that separate deals won from deals lost.

Join us TOMORROW February 17 at 12:00 PM CET for a 60-minute deep dive:

✅ The 5 objections killing 80% of deals (backed by conversation intelligence data)

✅ How to surface YOUR most common objections automatically from call recordings

✅ The exact language patterns top performers use to turn ""no"" into ""tell me more""

✅ How to build an objection handling playbook that updates itself with every call

✅ Patrick's coaching framework that actually changes sales reps behavior

This isn't theory.

This is what the data shows when you analyze real objections from real calls.

Stop guessing. Start using your own call data to build objection handling that actually works.

Gartner says: 50% of sales leaders trust their forecast. The rest? Flying blind. 🚨

If you’re scaling a team, hiring, or investing, guessing is not an option. 💸

Here’s what most teams still do:
• Rely on gut feeling 🙈
• Fight with spreadsheets 🗂️
• Spend hours on pipeline calls 📞

But there’s one resource almost everyone ignores:
• Conversation data - calls, emails, messages 💬

Let me break it down:

AI now analyzes what reps say (and what buyers say back)
It finds patterns in deals that close (and deals that fall apart)
It predicts future revenue based on buyer signals, not hope

It’s like coaching a football team by watching the games, not just reading the stats.

At Kickscale FlexCo, I’ve seen companies jump from guessing to 90%+ confidence in their numbers after using real sales conversations. 🤯

No magic. No wishful thinking.

• Repeat what works 🔁
• Cut out the noise 🧹

• Check for questions ❓ (Their needs first - always!)
• Agree on time ⏰ (Respect matters)

Why does this work? Because:

• No guessing in the room
• Buyers feel safe (Hello, trust!)
• My team stays sharp

AI is now part of every conversation. People want new ideas. They want speed. They want results. (No fluff, please! )

The magic happens when you LISTEN. Really listen. Like your job depends on it. 👂

• Hear pain points
• Map out what’s broken
• Spot chances to help

And then? Keep it simple:

• Show the fix
• Connect the dots to their problem
• Skip the boring pitch

I measure every call. I love sharing data. If my team wins, I win. If we mess up, we learn. 🚀

Huge THANK YOU to Lufthansa City Centers for all the smart questions and great energy. 🙏

Sales meetings with real talk + real structure = pure power. 💥

How did your last sales call go?
What do you wish you did differently? (Curious to hear!) 👀

I see it every week in B2B SaaS sales.  
Teams rush into demos, hoping to impress with features and slides.  
But the prospect sits there, lost.  
No connection. No buy-in. No deal. 😶

Here’s what actually works (and what we do at Kickscale):

1️⃣ Set the stage  
• Quick intro 🤝  
• Clear agenda 📋  
• Define the goal 🎯  
• Make sure everyone knows what’s coming (no surprises!)  

2️⃣ Go deep in discovery  
• Ask open-ended questions 🔍  
• “How do you handle X today?”  
• “What’s the real impact of Y?”  
• Dig for pain points, not surface answers  
• Listen for emotion, not just facts 👂❤️  

3️⃣ Solution mapping + demo  
• Connect every feature to what you learned in discovery  
• Show exactly how your solution fixes THEIR problems  
• No generic demo, no fluff  
• Make it personal and relevant (this is where the magic happens ✨)  

4️⃣ Next steps + closing  
• Clear summary  
• Offer, terms, action items  
• Only after you’ve built trust and understood their world  

Most sales meetings take 1–3 rounds.  
But the structure stays the same:  
• Open strong  
• Discover deep  
• Map solutions  
• Close with clarity

If you skip discovery, you’re gambling.  
If you go deep, you win deals. 🏆

That’s how we help revenue teams scale with AI at Kickscale.

Every month, I go through every conversation, email, and customer note. Not because I have time to waste, but because without these insights, everything else is just guesswork. 🕵️‍♂️

Sure, the sales team sells, marketing pushes content, product keeps building.
But what really sticks? What do customers actually love? What makes them stay or walk away?

I see comments like:

“Saves me so much time!” ⏰
“Finally insights I understand.” 🔍
“So easy to use!” 🧩
“The CRM integration is a gamechanger.” 🔗
Nice, right? But here’s the kicker: 90% of the positive feedback revolves around these exact four points.
Not flashy features. Not add-ons. Just everyday impact.

We then channel these insights directly into:

Pitch decks and sales emails ✉️
Marketing posts and website copy 🌐
Objection handling in calls ☎️
(And yes, sometimes even the product backlog, because if eight customers mention the same thing… it’s not a coincidence.)

It feels like extra work at first. But it’s the difference between “We think we know what works” and “We know what works.” 💡

So if you're a sales leader, founder, or CEO wondering why you’re winning (or losing) deals ... create your own monthly feedback report.

No AI tool can replace real customer insights.

Let’s get real for a second.

Sales is not only about targets and numbers. It’s about emotions-highs, lows, everything in between. 😅❤️

Most people see the results. They don’t see the late nights, the stress, the moments when you feel unbeatable… or totally crushed. 🥊🌊

For me, music is the bridge.

Every time I hit a big milestone, face a tough challenge, or need to find my peak state (thanks Tony Robbins 🤖), I add a song to my playlist. Gerald Life is more than a Spotify mix-it’s my personal soundtrack. 🎧✨

Some tracks remind me of closing deals in Las Vegas with Bitmovin. 🌆💥

Others bring back memories of celebrating with my team after a win. 🙌🏆

A few help me through the tough days when pipeline is thin and motivation is low. 🏔️🧘‍♂️

Some others I played when a girlfriend broke up with me. 💔

Each song means something:
• Footprints by Tiesto, standing in front of the Bellagio, dreaming bigger than ever. 🏛️🌎
• Playlists for moments of grace, guidance, connection. (ask my future wife, as I'm playing most of the tracks in repeat mode) 💑👫
• Tracks that push me to build something people love, something that scales. 🚀🔥

Grateful for my team, our users, and everyone who’s part of this wild journey. Let’s keep sharing, keep building, keep growing. 🙏🌟

We set out in Q1 with a simple goal: win two customers outside the DACH region.

Mission accomplished-in January. 💥

Now, Kickscale FlexCo is working with:
🔹 Visma from Finland, delivering software that simplifies the work lives of entrepreneurs, businesses, and societies 🇫🇮

🔹 bunny.net from Slovenia, trusted partners since Bitmovin days. Bunny brings together CDN, security, and compute into a single lightning-fast platform, designed to give you the edge. 🇸🇮

For years, Kickscale was known as the go-to solution for:
📝 Note-taking & transcribing in Germany, Austria, Switzerland
🤖 Revenue intelligence & forecasting
🏆 AI-powered sales coaching for managers

But these new partnerships prove something bigger:
European businesses want digital sovereignty. 🌍
They want innovation that fits their rules, their needs, their language.

Especially now, when you see what’s happening overseas.
(Trump says one thing on Monday, flips it on Tuesday. You know the drill. 🇺🇸🤦)

We built Kickscale for Europe.
Not chasing the US market.
Not compromising on privacy, trust, or local expertise.

Seeing Visma and bunny.net choose Kickscale is huge. 🙏

It shows:
🔥 We can scale outside the DACH bubble
🔥 European conversational intelligence matters
🔥 Our team is building a product customers love (big shoutout to our product & engineering crew! 👏🤝)

Today I’m on my way to Frankfurt for a special event with Lufthansa City Centers. 🚄

Why am I excited? Because we’re seeing real traction outside the classic B2B software space. Lufthansa City Centers is leading the way-using Kickscale to transform how sales teams work. 💥

Here’s what’s different now:

• Meetings are captured by AI (no more scribbling notes) 📝
• Every detail is recorded, so reps know what customers want
• Follow-ups are sent automatically (no more missed action items) 📧
• CRM gets updated in seconds, not hours ⏱️

What does that mean?

• Less admin. More time for real conversations. 🤝
• Reps can focus on selling, not paperwork.
• Managers finally see what’s happening in every deal-no guessing.

Our AI-powered note-taking helps sales teams:

• Listen better 👂
• Act faster 🚀
• Win more deals 🎯

A big THANK YOU to Verena and the Lufthansa team for organizing this event. 🙏

feedback without data is just noise. 🎯

I’ve seen it again and again.

Sales teams get together, talk about what went well, what didn’t, swap stories, and share gut feelings.

But without concrete data - it’s all just noise. 🔊

When Ben and I sat down, he shared the same truth:

👉 To coach sales reps, you need real input from recorded conversations.
👉 To improve, you need to reflect on what 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 happened.
👉 Otherwise, coaching is just guesswork.

That’s why we built our solution. 🤖

𝗞𝗶𝗰𝗸𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲 helps sales teams learn from every call:
• See the real objections buyers raise 🛑
• Spot what excites customers most ✨
• Understand which questions spark real conversations ❓
• Track where deals go off track 🚧

Ben works with scale-ups, startups and sales leaders as a coach, interim CRO, and head of sales. The feedback he gives is always grounded in the data.

It’s a game-changer. 💥

As a head of sales, you want to know:
• What are the biggest challenges in your org? 🔍
• What do your reps care about? ❤️
• Where do they need help to win more deals? 🏆

Without data, you’re flying blind.

I’m proud to work with partners like Ben - learning from him, helping him, and raising the bar for every rep.

We’re working with a company that raised $100M+ and needs to scale their sales team fast.

This is where early-stage hiring breaks. It stops being about people and becomes about systems.

At 10 reps, instinct works. At 200, instinct is just expensive guessing.

They have a strong brand. Inbound is fine. The problem is different:

Can you identify the top 10% fast enough?

Can you close them before competitors do?

What breaks when scaling sales:

Too many interview rounds. Too many stakeholders. Everyone’s “too busy” for feedback loops. Decisions take weeks.

Quality without speed loses the market.

Learned this strange thing about the Danish labor market the other day.

I’ve written before about Sweden’s problem. High unemployment, skills in the wrong places.

Denmark is the inverse. Almost full employment, but zero mobility.

I spoke with an executive at one of Denmark’s largest staffing firms. 20 years in the market. He said he’s never seen this before. Unemployment at 2.6%, yet switching jobs has become surprisingly hard.

His take: The economy is slowing and companies see it comingThey stop hiring but don’t lay people offThey keep workers they don’t fully need because if it takes off again it is hard to find new poeple. 

So the market is frozen.

•⁠ ⁠Employees don’t move because there are no real openings
•⁠ ⁠⁠Companies can’t hire because no one is “available”
•⁠ ⁠⁠The few roles that exist get filled through closed networks

You don’t get 300k+ unfilled roles alongside mass youth unemployment by accident. That’s not just wages or working conditions, it’s signalling.
First, the cultural hierarchy of work is real.

Frontline roles are quietly framed as second-tier and are rarely described as skilled or aspirational, regardless of their economic importance.

Second, the education-to-work pathway is broken (Compared to Germany).

France overwhelmingly rewards academic trajectories while underinvesting in credible vocational routes. Apprenticeships remain marginal compared to countries like Germany, where the dual work-study system is a default, respected path.

UK: Experienced electricians £38,000-52,000 vs. graduate starting salaries £30,000-36,000.

Denmark: €56,000-76,000 vs. graduates €43,000-60,000.

Norway: Electricians €52,000-64,000 vs. graduates €47,000-54,000.

This wasn't supposed to happen. 

The narrative for decades was clear: get a degree, earn more. 

Skip university for trades, earn less. 

That assumption is breaking down across multiple European markets.

The math is straightforward. 

Electricians spend 3-4 years in paid apprenticeships earning while learning. 

University graduates spend 3-4 years paying tuition while accumulating debt.

Been talking to retail leaders every week, and this pattern keeps showing up.

This is a structural problem, not a talent one.

In many large retail and hospitality chains, the person running the floor is also expected to:

• Screen 100+ CVs
• Call candidates
• Schedule interviews
• While managing sales, staffing gaps, inventory, and customer issues

That’s a broken operating model.

Store managers should run the business. They should make final hiring decisions. They should not be a decentralised HR function.

High-volume hiring needs to be centralised.

A better model:

• Central team owns sourcing, screening, and first contact
• Only qualified candidates reach the store
• Store manager interviews the final 5–10 and decides

Managers are strong at evaluating people face-to-face. They are bad at processing volume and admin, especially under daily operational pressure.

Most mass-hiring companies still treat hiring as “the manager’s problem”.
In reality, it’s a core business function that needs scale, consistency, and focus.

If every store runs hiring differently, quality will always be uneven. Centralise the pipeline. Let managers do what they’re best at.","Eric André","activity","urn:li:share:7421475953400504322","2025-11-22","Valid 7421475954339770369","ACoAAAmqsIQBpAOZ2SGx09b0wM8RM3VEz5ZfgZk","ACwAAAmq","ACwAAAmqsIQBFkif1VVqV3_Ex1Xfzb0rypG1J2U","ACwAAAmq","✅ Record Found","true",,false

They ask for years of experience. They check past quotas. They review previous roles. But none of that predicts who will actually succeed.

What predicts success in sales roles: motivation and resilience. 

Will you keep going after hearing no twenty times a day? Will you stick around when you have a bad quarter?

Those two things matter more than anything on a resume. 

A sales rep with 3 years of experience who would rather be an AE is worse than someone with no experience who stays motivated through rejection and keeps pushing.

The problem is most job posts don't assess this. 

They focus on credentials that look good on paper but don't tell you if someone will last past the first three months.

The companies that figure out how to hire for motivation and resilience fill sales roles faster and keep people longer.

High volume hiring needs to grow up and become as data-driven as performance marketing.

Hiring is a funnel. You’re competing for attention. It’s not 2005.

Right now, most companies do the opposite:

CV, resume, years of experience, education

100+ clicks before the application is even done

Frontline candidates see that and leave. We see churn as high as 70% halfway through.

Consumer companies solved this years ago.

Hardly marketing? 

Extremely competitive, and AI is getting good at the simple tasks - copy, campaigns, basic analysis. If you're not one of the really good ones, you end up in a wall of applicants.

Coding? 

A lot of jobs, but it's getting harder and harder to be great at. Everyone's running toward AI and software engineering, but there are only so many of those jobs.

Plumber? Electrician?

They describe the hard parts upfront.

It's called a Realistic Job Preview. You tell candidates exactly what the job is like on a bad day, then ask if that's still what they want.

For a sales role: 

""You'll spend eight hours a week on the phone doing cold outreach. You'll get a lot of no's. If you do well, you can make good money. Does working in this environment excite you?""

For a warehouse role: 

""You'll be lifting heavy packages in a cold environment for eight-hour shifts. Is that something you're comfortable with?""

What happens is candidates self-select out early instead of quitting after two weeks when they realize the job isn't what they thought.

Even though it's high-performing in tech, the general economy isn't doing quite well.

Here's the paradox: 3/4 Swedish companies can't find people with the right skills. 

There's a lot of talent, just not trained for the right jobs.

The labor market is screaming for plumbers, electricians, construction workers. 

These are well-paid jobs with high job security. 

Electricians earn 40,000-50,000 SEK monthly. 

Plumbers earn 38,000-42,000 SEK.

That number has nearly doubled in the past decade. At the same time, youth unemployment sits at 24%. 

Labor shortages and long-term unemployment are rising together.

Why isn't reskilling happening faster? 

Part of it is structural - career guidance in schools still pushes university paths. 

Part of it is demographics - skilled workers are retiring faster than young people are entering trades.

Mainly I think it is cultural - trades are seen as bad, low-status and fallback careers.

The job market flipped, and nobody updated the career advice.

Office jobs that seemed safe are now oversaturated. Trades that people dismissed as fallbacks are becoming the stable choice. 

Youth unemployment hit 16% in the UK, the highest in over a decade. At the same time, employers are desperate for electricians, plumbers, welders, and HGV drivers.

Part of this is demographics - skilled workers are retiring faster than young people are entering trades. 

Part of it is economics - net-zero retrofits, EV infrastructure, and housing targets all need hands-on work that can't be done remotely or automated away.

The UK government is responding by boosting apprenticeship funding from April 2026, offering free Level 3 courses in trades with guaranteed placements.

What's accelerating this shift is AI. 

Marketing, copywriting, and customer service roles are getting automated, but you can't automate an electrician installing EV chargers or a plumber retrofitting homes for net-zero.

But one lesson stayed with me more than the rest.

You can’t skip performance management. Not for yourself. Not for your team.

In the early stage, everyone is drowning in work. Focus is everything. And the first thing to get deprioritised is usually people. 

At Voi we scaled to 500 hires in a few months. 

Chaos was unavoidable, but the real issue was that we were a very young management team and we didn’t build feedback and development muscle early enough. 

To be clear, Voi is top class at this today.

Looking back, spending just 2 hours per employee per month would have saved us huge headaches and huge costs. That investment compounds fast.

Creating a direct feedback and performance culture early is non negotiable. We’re doing this at Kiku - started with the founders and scaling it as we grow.
My take:

Founders - if you haven’t set this up, make it happen. It will save you.

Employees - if your manager doesn’t give you structured feedback, ask for it.

Losing a LinkedIn account hurts more than losing a domain. You can buy a new domain and keep going. But a profile — that's your network, reputation, and trust. Losing it sets you back.

LinkedIn has become less pleasant in recent years because of spam, but if a decision-maker has a LinkedIn and no email — why not use this channel?

Here are three rules I use in practice 👇

1. A warmed-up account

1) No more than 20 connects per day and 100 per week. Raise the limit gradually — by +2 per day.
2) Get Premium: paying users generate more trust.
3) The account should look ""alive"": About section, experience, skills, certifications, photo, posts.

❕The more complete the profile, the higher the connection acceptance rate.

2. Messages under 100 words
In a connection request it's better to write nothing — it almost always kills conversion. The exception is if you have a real shared touchpoint (like meeting at a conference).

First message:

- short,
- clear,
- no fluff.

One thought, one value, one action.

3. ""Show up"" before connecting
We don't send an invite cold. We run a sequence:

1) Visited their profile — the person sees a notification.
2) The next day, liked a post.
3) Endorsed 1–2 skills.
Only then sent the connect.

This creates a recognition effect: ""I've seen this person before.""
Conversion is higher than with mass campaigns.

LinkedIn outreach isn't about ""spray invites and forget."" Everything matters: limits, warm-up, profile, message structure.

In our case: scripts or database - what comes first, and what matters more?

Let me explain with an example.

Imagine we sell premium Cuban cigars - top-tier product. The goal is to sell.

We have two business development managers.

One is responsible for *who we sell to*. He studies the ideal customer profile, identifies relevant communities and clubs, negotiates with specialty tobacco shops - but doesn’t dive deep into sales psychology.

The other focuses on *how we sell*. He crafts the perfect pitch, polishes the offer down to the smallest detail, incorporates every psychological trigger - so sharp that even Robert Cialdini would be impressed. And then he goes out and tries to sell to fitness enthusiasts, pregnant women, and people with asthma.

Who will actually make sales?

Even the most personalized, research-backed script is completely useless if we miss our buyer profile.

If there’s no need - not even an indirect one. The best script in the world won’t help.

Are we saying scripts don’t matter? Not at all.

Scripts increase conversion.
But a well-built database gives conversion its foundation.

All the other tactics and growth hacks - like optimizing the number of touchpoints per contact are secondary.

First, build your database around your ICP.
Then refine your PMF inside your scripts.

Desired outcome: the reader opens because something struck a chord

2) Preview line / Opening paragraph
Goal: hook them, spark curiosity, stick in their head
Desired outcome: “Alright… what is this person offering me?”

3) Paragraph 2
Goal: quickly explain the value, qualify relevance
Desired outcome:
“Interesting - we don’t have this right now / we do, but it’s not working well,” or
“No pain here because…”

4) Paragraph 3
Goal: move to the target action
Desired outcome: they agree to get extra materials, or they say no (with a clear reason)

Lately I have started diving more actively into frameworks, of which there are a million thousand billion. Digging into each one is very tedious and does not make much sense, so I will show a kind of base that can be used to build a structure.

1. Value Proposition Matrix.
This is a list of VPs that we test in hypotheses. Essentially, this is what we sell, our product and its key features. Without a VP there is no point in doing anything further, so it is critically important to find PMF (otherwise why do active outreach at this stage).

A VP consists of 3 points:
Job to be Done: what task the client is trying to accomplish
Pain/Friction: what gets in the way (expensive, risky, unstable)
Outcome/Metric: what “better” looks like (in measurable terms)

2. ICP.
This includes everything except vertical and sub-vertical: role (primary, influencer, economic buyer), revenue, size, etc. Here we define our audience, who we are writing to, and specify all the criteria we need.

Important: 1 ICP = 1 hypothesis.

3. Vertical & Sub-Vertical. Everything is simple here, we define the target vertical and sub-vertical, in other words, the industry.

4. Forming a hypothesis.
  We specify everything defined above, plus:

Pain: what exactly hurts (specifically)
Signal: how we will understand that the hypothesis is alive (measurable, for example “ready to give access to the admin panel”)

5. TAL (Target Account List).
  Our list of accounts that fully match our ICP. Important: if you cannot explain which hypothesis it is testing, it is just a lead list.

6. Scripts. Everything is simple here. The script should contain the VP and be oriented toward the ICP and its pain. More details about scripts can be found in this post.

7. Calls. Each call is tied to a hypothesis and an account from the TAL.

8. Metrics. Metrics are needed to answer: “validate, kill, or refine?”. How to use them: look at metrics by hypothesis, not “overall sales”.

Typical signals:

* pain confirmation rate (share of conversations where the person confirms the pain themselves, not just politely nods)
* interest rate (percentage of conversations where the person showed proactive interest, not just listened)
* opportunities / follow-ups (share of conversations where a next step appeared)
* speed of signal acquisition (how many conversations it took to first hear confirmed pain, get the first follow-up, see pattern repetition)

If pain confirmation is low or absent, the hypothesis is not valid. If there is interest but no next steps, the VP needs fixing. If the speed of signal acquisition is low, we are pulling SQL out of thin air.

As a result, we either discard the hypothesis, or expand our TAL for a fuller picture, or recognize the hypothesis as valid and scale it.","Savelii Kosovanov","activity","urn:li:share:7426586965761753088","2025-11-22","Valid 7426586968479686656","ACoAAGIpxcoBAm_-_sBW4yg3rGUjPhFx7JrF5r0","ACwAAGIp","ACwAAGIpxcoBTp-Hj22AErJIP4l1VQS35MBMBDQ","ACwAAGIp","✅ Record Found","false",,false

Sobre todo si hablamos del turismo chino, que coincidiendo con el Año Nuevo, por fin parece que recupera el ritmo de antes.

Pero hay algo que me preocupa cuando veo cómo reaccionan algunas marcas.

Muchos se obsesionan con el volumen. Con que vengan ""muchos"".

Y creo que la clave no está ahí, sino en la oportunidad financiera.

El ticket medio de este perfil es altísimo comparado con otros.

Sin embargo, veo cometer un error de novato constantemente:

Pensar que con tener la tienda abierta y un datáfono de toda la vida es suficiente.

Spoiler: No lo es.

Para este cliente, si no estás en su ecosistema digital, eres invisible.

Literalmente.

No importa lo bonito que sea tu escaparate si no pueden pagarte con lo que usan a diario en su país.

Para capitalizar este rebote del turismo hay que romper esa barrera:

- Aceptar sus métodos de pago nativos, Alipay+ y WeChat Pay
- Entender sus aplicaciones, REDNOTE, Weibo, Bilibili...
- Estar presentes donde ellos buscan

Si esperas que ellos se adapten a tu sistema, estás perdiendo dinero.

La oportunidad es gigante, pero hay que ponérselo fácil.

Un abrazo fuerte a todos mis amigos, colaboradores y clientes que, como nosotros, ven en el consumidor chino una gran oportunidad y una fuente de inspiración constante.

Esta semana empieza el Año del Caballo de Fuego 🔥
Una época de energía, impulso y movimiento — y también una de las semanas con más turismo chino en Europa.

Para muchos comercios, es una oportunidad real de generar más ingresos.
Especialmente para aquellos que ya están adaptados a sus hábitos, canales y formas de pago.

En STAMP trabajamos precisamente en eso: hacer que cada turista se sienta como en casa desde el primer “clic” o desde el primer pago.

Durante años, el tax free ha sido un trámite incómodo, tanto para el comercio como para el turista.
Un “mal necesario” que, aunque obligatorio, no se ha aprovechado como lo que realmente es: una herramienta comercial de alto valor.

En STAMP lo vimos claro desde el principio:
El tax free podía dejar de ser un coste de oportunidad, para convertirse en una ventaja competitiva.


El modelo tradicional: comisiones, burocracia y oportunidades perdidas

Para un turista, el proceso habitual de tax free implica:

     - Pagar el IVA completo en tienda.
     - Esperar colas en el aeropuerto.
     - Rellenar formularios.
     - Y confiar en que el reembolso (con suerte parcial) llegará semanas después.

El resultado: frustración. 😡 
Y para el comercio: menos conversión y menor ticket medio.


🚀 🚀 🚀  Con STAMP, el Tax Free se convierte en un descuento directo y en una palanca de ventas

Hemos desarrollado una solución que:
     - Permite al turista no pagar el IVA desde el primer momento.
     - Elimina la percepción de “papeleo” o “reembolso futuro”.
     - Se integra fácilmente en cualquier punto de venta.
     - Cumple con la normativa y protege al comercio ante devoluciones o errores.
     - Se convierte en un argumento de cierre de venta en tienda.


¿Qué consiguen las marcas con esto?

     - Mayor conversión: cuando el turista ve un -21% directo en el ticket, la decisión de compra se acelera.
     - Tickets medios más altos: si ya iba a comprar, ahora compra más.
     - Una experiencia memorable: lo sencillo vende más, y fideliza más.
     - Diferenciación real frente a la competencia.
     - Más visibilidad en ecosistemas digitales asiáticos.","Alvaro Fontaneda","activity","urn:li:share:7427751462409134082","2025-11-22","Valid 7427751463440867328","ACoAAANbesEB3Fy-vTtokqgX96avyCCwMwDu_4E","ACwAAANb","ACwAAANbesEBu7ULhqAmEUnJlX3ZYQE6tK6poHg","ACwAAANb","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Esta semana he tenido el placer de ofrecer una mentoría sobre emprendimiento a los alumnos de IMMUNE Technology Institute.
Y, como siempre que comparto experiencias con estudiantes con tantas ganas de aprender, me llevé más de lo que di.

Porque ver esas ganas, esas dudas y esa energía…
me recordó a mis primeros pasos como emprendedor, hace ya más de 15 años.

¿Qué les dije?

Que emprender no es fácil.
Y que muchas veces, al empezar, ni siquiera sabes a qué te enfrentas.

Que si realmente quieres construir algo con impacto, tienes que:

Enamorarte del problema, no de tu producto.
Validar tu idea lo antes posible.
Y, sobre todo, escuchar muchísimo.

Les hablé también de lo que no se enseña en libros:
           No hay fórmulas mágicas.
           No hay caminos rectos.
           Y que la receta más honesta de éxito es esta:
           trabajo, trabajo y perseverancia.

Gracias a todo el equipo de IMMUNE por la invitación, y gracias en especial a Antonio Ruggiero por contar conmigo y facilitarlo todo con tanta generosidad y profesionalismo.

Mentorizar es una forma de devolver lo que un día otros hicieron por nosotros.
Y para mí, también, una forma de seguir aprendiendo.

…y la terminamos con una noticia que nos hace casi tanta ilusión (si no más). 😳 😳 😳 

Le pedimos a ChatGPT que, de forma objetiva y neutral, comparara a STAMP con uno de los grandes referentes del sector: Global Blue.
La pregunta fue sencilla:
¿Cuál es mejor opción para un turista internacional que quiere hacer tax free?

Y este fue el resultado (sin trampa ni cartón):
En casi todos los criterios que ChatGPT decidió analizar por su cuenta -transparencia, costes, simplicidad del proceso- STAMP sale ganando.

          ---> Adjunto la imagen generada como parte del análisis.


¿Por qué es importante?

Porque no lo decimos nosotros.
Lo dice un modelo de IA, sin sesgo, sin marca y sin interés, cuando se le pide una comparación objetiva.

Y lo más relevante es lo que concluye:

✅ Si el objetivo del turista es pagar menos comisiones y tener una experiencia más clara, rápida y simple, STAMP es la mejor opción disponible.


¿Estamos diciendo que ChatGPT 🤖 es el nuevo analista del sector?

No.
Pero sí demuestra que, cuando la innovación se construye con lógica, experiencia de usuario y tecnología bien aplicada, las soluciones hablan por sí solas.

Seguiremos mejorando cada día para seguir mereciendo este tipo de comparaciones.

Gracias a todo el equipo, partners y comercios que hacen posible que estemos redefiniendo juntos el tax free en Europa.
Esto no va solo de tecnología, va de cambiar la forma en la que los turistas consumen.
Y de ayudar a que los comercios vendan más y mejor.

Spoiler: No es así.

Recientemente he gestionado la unión de dos compañías complementarias y el éxito no estuvo en los números, sino en un método de 3 pasos que aplico siempre para consolidar proyectos:

1️⃣ Buscar la coincidencia de ecosistemas
No se trata de sumar por sumar. Antes de firmar nada, validamos que ambas empresas compartían el mismo mercado B2B y el mismo perfil de usuario final. Si las piezas del puzzle no encajan de forma natural en el mercado, no las fuerces en el papel.

2️⃣ Skin in the game (Canje de acciones)
En lugar de una compraventa tradicional, optamos por un modelo de canje. ¿El objetivo? Que nadie ""salga"" del proyecto, sino que todos se comprometan con la nueva etapa. Es vital para mantener la motivación alta.

3️⃣ Alineación humana (El paso crítico)
Aquí es donde fallan la mayoría. De nada sirve lo anterior si la cultura se rompe. Mi foco principal fue coordinar a socios fundadores muy distintos e integrar a los equipos para que, desde el día 1, toda la organización remara en la misma dirección.

Las empresas las hacen las personas. Si no gestionas los egos, las expectativas y la cultura, no hay fusión que valga.

Para vosotros, ¿qué es lo más difícil en una integración: cuadrar las finanzas o alinear a las personas?

Cada diciembre nuestras calles se llenan de luces, el ambiente cambia y la alegría invade las ciudades. Y, casi sin darnos cuenta, llega un visitante muy especial: el turista internacional con ganas de vivir la ciudad… y de comprar.

Asoaciamos el turismo con el verano, pero la realidad es que la Navidad se ha consolidado como un segundo gran momento turístico, especialmente en destinos urbanos. España está a las puertas de alcanzar los 100 millones de turistas anuales precisamente porque recibe visitantes durante todo el año, no solo en los meses estivales. Y diciembre juega un papel clave en esa ecuación. Si no, que se lo pregunten a Vigo.

No es casualidad que ciudades como Vigo se promocionen en mercados tan lejanos como Nueva York. La razón es sencilla: el turista navideño es un visitante de alto impacto económico. Viaja con intención, busca experiencias, regalos y recuerdos, y su paso por la ciudad deja huella en hoteles, restaurantes… y, sobre todo, en el comercio local.

Pero lo más interesante no es solo cuántos turistas llegan, sino cómo se comportan. El viajero de diciembre suele ser más urbano, más cultural y claramente más comprador. Quiere pasear, descubrir barrios emblemáticos y llevarse algo especial del destino.

Aquí el comercio juega un papel fundamental. Vemos cómo grupos relativamente pequeños de visitantes —chinos, estadounidenses o suizos— concentran una parte muy significativa de las compras Tax Free. 

De hecho, las compras Tax Free en España crecen con fuerza en diciembre, con incrementos superiores al 20% interanual. Y no es casualidad que las ciudades concentren gran parte de esta actividad: están diseñadas para pasear, disfrutar… y comprar.

En Navidad, además, entra en juego un factor decisivo: la experiencia de compra. El turista valora más que nunca la comodidad, la rapidez y el ahorro inmediato. Quiere entrar en una tienda, entender qué compra, cuánto se ahorra y seguir disfrutando de la ciudad sin complicaciones.

Por eso, modelos de Tax Free más simples y con descuento directo del IVA en tienda, como el que ofrece STAMP, encajan tan bien con este perfil. No solo facilitan la compra: la impulsan.

La Navidad no es solo una época bonita. Es una gran oportunidad para el comercio local. Entender al turista internacional y ponérselo fácil puede marcar la diferencia entre una tienda llena… y una venta que nunca llegó a producirse.","Alvaro Fontaneda","activity","urn:li:share:7405196001189466112","2025-11-22","Valid 7405196002246422529","ACoAAANbesEB3Fy-vTtokqgX96avyCCwMwDu_4E","ACwAAANb","ACwAAANbesEBu7ULhqAmEUnJlX3ZYQE6tK6poHg","ACwAAANb","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Hay momentos que te cambian la vida sin darte cuenta.
El mío fue bastante simple: una actualización de WeChat, el WhatsApp chino.

Un día, siendo usuario habitual, aparecieron los pagos dentro de la app.
De repente, con la misma aplicación con la que hablaba con amigos podía pagar en comercios, enviar dinero a personas y mover mi día a día sin tarjetas, sin efectivo y sin fricciones. Todo integrado. Todo natural.

Y pensé:
“Esto no es el futuro. Esto es el presente… pero en Europa aún no existe.”

Ese fue el clic.

La intuición que te dice: aquí hay algo grande.

Así nació Starpay, el intento de traer ese modelo de pagos a Europa. Como cualquier founder al principio, tiré del instinto. Creía en lo que había visto. Creía que aquí tendría sentido. Y el instinto es un gran combustible… pero también puede ser un espejismo si no lo aterrizas.
Porque llega un momento en el que tienes que dejar de escucharte solo a ti. Tienes que escuchar a la calle.

El MVP no es un producto: es una prueba de humildad. Te obliga a enseñar tu idea desnuda, a validar sin enamorarte, a descubrir si lo que tú crees que es un problema… realmente lo es.
Y en ese proceso llegó otro descubrimiento importante, los pagos eran solo el comienzo. Los comercios necesitaban algo más.

El Tax Free -un proceso crítico para ellos- seguía siendo lento, manual y totalmente desconectado de cómo el turista ya operaba en su día a día.
Ahí entendimos que, si queríamos ayudarles de verdad, no bastaba con permitir a los turistas usar sus medios de pago habituales, teníamos que reinventar el Tax Free.

Y de esa necesidad nace Stamp.

Stamp existe para hacer que el Tax Free sea Real, Simple y Transparente, basado en la exención del IVA en el punto de venta. Creemos en un modelo donde el viajero no “recupera parte” del IVA… sino que directamente no lo paga.
Stamp es lo que ocurre cuando combinas intuición, visión y escucha real del mercado.

Mirando hacia atrás, el camino tiene un patrón muy claro:

•	El instinto te da el inicio.

•	La visión te mantiene firme.

Empecé este viaje fascinado por cómo se pagaba en Asia.

La apuesta por una mayor conectividad con China y por un modelo de turismo de calidad encaja a la perfección con lo que desde STAMP trabajamos cada día: ayudar al comercio madrileño a vender más, ofrecer una experiencia de compra más sencilla al viajero internacional y convertir cada visita en mayor valor económico para la ciudad.

El turista chino busca cultura, gastronomía y, cada vez más, una “local shopping experience”; y Madrid tiene todos los ingredientes para convertirse en su destino de referencia. Con iniciativas como estas y gracias al impulso del Ayuntamiento de Madrid , estamos más cerca de posicionar a Madrid como el gran hub entre Asia e Hispanoamérica.

Un gran trabajo el que están desarrollando Almudena Maillo y su equipo!

Estudié arquitectura porque desde niño me fascinaba imaginar espacios y darles forma. Soñaba con crear lugares que la gente pudiera habitar. Me formé en la Universidad de Navarra, trabajé en España, pasé por EE.UU., y luego… llegó China.

Una promotora española me envió a China para participar en un “pequeño” proyecto de más de 2.000 viviendas, espacios comerciales, un hospital, colegio... Lo que allí se consideraba un desarrollo más, en España habría sido construir un pueblo.

China fue un antes y un después. Era una sociedad en plena transformación, sin mapas ni instrucciones. Cada día allí era un acto de emprendimiento. Y así fue como di el salto: con mis socios, lanzamos uno de los primeros espacios de coworking de China. Oficinas con alma en una ciudad donde todo parecía salido de un ministerio.

Ese proyecto se convirtió en un ecosistema: oficinas, cafés, restaurantes, gimnasios… 

Años después… fundé un nuevo despacho de arquitectura, donde diseñamos desde villas de lujo hasta hoteles cinco estrellas, pasando por restaurantes, tiendas, museos…

Pero sentía que era el momento de volver a Europa. Y no solo dejé China: dejé también la arquitectura.

Me pregunté: ¿qué había en China que Europa aún no tenía?

Y la respuesta fue clara: tecnología que uniera consumidores con comercios.

En superapps, métodos de pago, digitalización, marketing omnicanal dentro de superapps… China estaba años por delante.

Y así es como decidimos fundar una empresa para traer medios de pago asiáticos a Europa: WeChat Pay, Alipay, etc. No solo permitíamos a los turistas pagar como en casa, sino que ayudábamos a los comercios europeos a ser visibles en esos ecosistemas digitales.

Y esa experiencia me abrió las puertas al proyecto más ambicioso hasta ahora: STAMP.

Hace casi dos años, fundamos STAMP con la misión de revolucionar el Tax Free. Creamos lo que llamamos el Real Tax Free: el único modelo en el que el turista no paga el IVA de entrada. Lo que antes era burocracia y espera, ahora es un descuento directo en el momento de compra.

El resultado: los comercios venden más. Los viajeros compran con más facilidad. Y Europa, poco a poco, se adapta a una nueva forma de entender el consumo global.

Hoy, después de haber fusionado mis aprendizajes en pagos, tecnología y retail, puedo decir que estamos construyendo algo grande:

          - Una solución real, simple y digital.

          - Un aliado estratégico para el comercio europeo.

          - Un puente entre continentes.

Y todo empezó… soñando con construir espacios.","Alvaro Fontaneda","activity","urn:li:share:7401892980829110272","2025-11-22","Valid 7401892982062387200","ACoAAANbesEB3Fy-vTtokqgX96avyCCwMwDu_4E","ACwAAANb","ACwAAANbesEBu7ULhqAmEUnJlX3ZYQE6tK6poHg","ACwAAANb","✅ Record Found","true",,false

In 2026, this is no longer a standard. It’s a bottleneck.

If your growth depends on shipping physical hardware to every new location, you aren't scaling, you’re just adding weight.

True innovation is about dematerialization. We’ve proven that the intelligence of the algorithm is more powerful than the size of the sensor.

Deux lectures ont particulièrement inspiré la direction que nous souhaitons prendre :

📘 Into Thin Air de Jon Krakauer - ou comment “climb without breaking”
Le récit de la tragédie de l’Everest rappelle qu’une ambition extrême sans structure, lucidité et discipline peut faire basculer même les meilleures équipes. Croissance, pression, objectifs élevés… tout cela ne tient que si les fondamentaux sont solides : préparation, standards élevés, capacité à dire non et rigueur d’exécution.

📗 Endurance d’Alfred Lansing - ou comment “climb together”
L’histoire de Shackleton montre qu’une équipe performe durablement quand cohésion, confiance et responsabilité collective passent avant la performance individuelle. Dans l’incertitude, la solidité du collectif devient le premier facteur de réussite.

Chez Vocca, ces deux enseignements ont guidé la construction de nos OKR :
- accélérer fortement la croissance
- structurer des bases solides et scalables
- construire une équipe capable d’aller vite, longtemps, et ensemble

Hâte de voir ce que 2026 nous réserve.

🌎 From pilot in Mexico to global expansion: when results speak for themselves
Today we officially announce something we've been working on intensively: the expansion of our strategic alliance with Adecco México to all of Latin America and other UE countries of Adecco (RPO).

How we got here:
A few months ago, we started in Mexico. The bet was clear: prove that AI can transform mass recruitment without losing the human essence of the process. Then came Peru.

The results speak for themselves and are consistent across markets:

⏱️ 70% reduction in time to hire
✨ Better quality candidates
📊 80% proposal completion rate
💯 Candidate NPS >98%
🎯 100% fill rate

Today we take the leap we set as our goal on day one in the conversations between Orbio AI and Adecco.

What it's about:
We are redefining Mass Recruitment (RPO) with AI virtual agents that don't replace people, they empower them. We generate real connections between talent and opportunities, at scale, without sacrificing quality or the human touch.

Because for us, technology is the tool, but people are always the purpose.

An exceptional team:

None of this would exist without the Adecco team that has been involved in making this project a success story that will help improve efficiencies as a company and empower recruiters' work. Thanks a lot to Francisco Martínez Domene, Pierre Matuchet, Raül Giménez, Walter Hernandez, Giovanni Chavez, Alberto Del Castillo Román, Emmanuel Alvarado De Leon, Claudio Abdala, André R. and all the team involved. 

Many thanks also to all the Orbio AI team for the huge effort to bring them home and go, go, go Antonio Melé, Sergi Bastardas

These weren't coffee chats—they were intense sessions about architecture, data, UX,  GTM and how to make it work at real scale.

Today, seeing Orbio AI sharing the stage with Microsoft and NVIDIA in Madrid, talking about that vision made reality... it's a special moment.

We're not just building technology. We're redefining how companies hire, onboard, and manage talent. With conversational agents that speak 30+ languages, operate 24/7, and continuously learn.

Thanks to the Microsoft team - Jaime De Mora, Valle del Aguila Rodrigo, Adrián González Sánchez, Eduardo Arandilla, Elena González-Blanco García ,Karine REGNIEZ - for believing in what we're building.

When you're serving global markets, every hiring decision carries weight—not just for your organization, but for candidates' careers and your ability to build truly diverse, world-class teams across different regions and cultures.
Global clients need AI that works fairly everywhere.

That's why at Orbio AI, we've built our CV Screening system with a global compliance-first approach. We partnered with Warden AI for rigorous, independent third-party audits that test for bias across:
✓ Sex ✓ Race/Ethnicity
 ✓ Age ✓ Disability ✓ Religion ✓ Sexual Orientation

The results speak for themselves: 📊 11,888 profiles tested ✅ Clear ratings across all bias categories 🌍 Ready for the EU AI Act 🗽 Compliant with NYC Local Law 144

Why this matters for your global operations:

→ Consistent fairness across all markets and jurisdictions → Regulatory confidence whether you're hiring in Berlin, New York, or Singapore → One platform, multiple compliance standards met → Independent validation you can share with stakeholders and candidates → Future-proof technology as regulations evolve worldwide

When you serve clients globally, you can't afford AI that works in silos. You need responsible, audited, compliant AI from day one.

That's our commitment to you.","Nacho Travesí","activity","urn:li:share:7405194937643925504","2025-11-22","Valid 7405194938419683328","ACoAAA4Ef9YBKpCI_GHicFptW0yEwoYe7DT3s0c","ACwAAA4E","ACwAAA4Ef9YBdj_gzeS24ECD5o1beM1S6XnU3xA","ACwAAA4E","✅ Record Found","true",,false
,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7404823006679822336","Yes","📊 The 5 Metrics:

After analyzing hundreds of thousands of selection processes, we discovered something uncomfortable:

Most HR teams don't measure everything they should be measuring in their recruitment process management.

Here are the 5 metrics that we at Orbio AI believe truly predict success (and how we moved from theory to real results):

1️⃣ Application-to-Contact Ratio The black hole where 70% of your investment disappears

The honest question: If you spend €50K attracting talent... why do you ignore 70% of those who respond?

📉 Industry reality: 20-30% of candidates contacted
 ✅ With Orbio: 95-100% contacted

How we achieve it:
Smart automatic retries (not spam)
Multi-channel conversational approach adapted to each profile
Response in <90 seconds (not 24 hours)

2️⃣ Interview No-Show Rate:

📉 Industry benchmark: 25-35%
 💸 What nobody tells you: Thousands of hours of recruiters waiting for people who never show up
🔥 The painful truth: No-shows aren't bad luck. They're brutal feedback that the process doesn't work and it's been impossible for us to manually remind the candidate they had an interview for the job of their life.

Achievable goal: <1% (yes, you read that right)

How:
Automatic confirmations
Smart reminders
Frictionless rescheduling
Real engagement from first contact
🐎 Orbio result: 1% no-show rate (vs 30-35% traditional) = 60K-82K slots recovered/year

3️⃣ Time-to-First-Contact The race you're losing (and don't know it)
Day 1: Candidate applies (100% motivated)
Day 3: Already in 2-3 other processes
Day 5: 50% have accepted another offer
Day 10: Only 15% remain available

Your competition doesn't sleep. Neither should you.
🎯 Traditional standard: <72 hours
 🚀 With Orbio AI: <90 seconds

4️⃣ Candidate Experience Score (NPS)
Frustrated candidate today = negative review tomorrow
Delighted candidate = free brand ambassador

📈 Honest benchmark:
<60% = Houston, we have a problem
70-80% = You're average
85%+ = You're doing something right
98%+ = Complete game changer

💚 Orbio AI NPS: >98%

Why? Because the ""manual"" way of redacting video is broken. It’s slow, it’s expensive, and it’s incredibly prone to human error. When a FOIA or FERPA request comes in, operations grind to a halt while someone spends days blurring faces frame-by-frame.

We need to change the conversation from ""how do we store this?"" to ""how do we actually use this?""

The real value-add for your clients in 2026 isn't just a privacy checkbox—it's operational speed. By automating the redaction process, you’re giving them the ability to fulfil requests in minutes. You’re helping them be transparent with their communities without sacrificing a week of staff productivity.

Most of their clients are great at capturing video, but the ""keep everything"" mindset is becoming a massive compliance headache.

The reality? Every TB of unredacted footage sitting in a long-term archive is a PII breach waiting to happen. If a FOIA or HIPAA request hits their desk, they’re looking at a 40-hour manual redaction nightmare just to release a few clips. 🤯 

The smart shift: Redact before you archive. By processing video at the point of ingest, you strip away the risk early. You give your clients a clean, compliant library that’s ready to share instantly—no panic required.

Dealers: This is a great conversation to have with your clients. You aren't just selling storage; you're helping them de-risk their entire operation. It turns a ""retention problem"" into a ""privacy win.""

How are your clients handling the ""redact vs. retain"" balance right now? I'd love to hear what’s working in the field

#Operators are sitting on a new data business, and most don’t realize it yet.

At Skyfora, we see this very clearly through GNSS receivers already deployed in mobile networks. With the right competence, these receivers do far more than ""only"" timing and synchronization. They continuously measure atmospheric signal delay in 3D, effectively turning cell towers into any nation's largest real-time weather sensor grid.

This unlocks a new data layer for:
➡️ MNO network resilience and weather-aware operations
➡️ Improve weather-affected industrial operations
➡️ AI weather models that are high-res data-limited
➡️ New revenue streams from existing infrastructure, with only a software solution

For mobile operators and vendors, it’s about activating value that’s already there.

If you’re an operator or vendor thinking about network resilience, ESG or monetization beyond connectivity, now is the time to engage. 🌍⚡

👉 AI weather models are increasingly operational - more and better data unlocks higher spatial and temporal resolution and improved forecast accuracy.

Alexandros Matakos' presentation, “Telecom GNSS Meteorology: Assimilating Novel Atmospheric Observations with AI methods,” captured this perfectly. As AI models push toward higher spatial and temporal accuracy, progress depends on denser, more representative, and AI-ready observations across regions.

At AMS, two points were repeatedly reinforced:

1️⃣ Improving global AI weather models requires more data from the Global South, where persistent observation gaps still limit global model forecast skills.

2️⃣ Higher-resolution observations at short lead times (0–12 hours) are critical everywhere for improving regional and local forecast accuracy, especially for high-impact weather.

This strongly reinforces #TeamSkyfora’s mission: leveraging existing global telecom infrastructure to deliver real-time atmospheric data expanding global coverage while enabling high-resolution regional forecasting for next-generation AI models.

Big thanks to my Skyfora colleagues Alexandros Matakos, Kim Kaisti, and Jostein Mælan for the excellent customer and partner discussions, and the momentum throughout the week.

 ➡️ existing telecom and GNSS infrastructure can be upgraded with software  into a nationwide GNSS interference monitoring and alert grid.
 ➡️ continuous scanning, classification, heat maps and machine-readable alerts in real time.
 ➡️ dual-use capability that strengthens national resilience without deploying new hardware.

AI agents & AI workflows are failing because Enterprise data is broken. At Boost.space, we’ve spent more than 5 years building the Context Data Layer that fixes it.

We’re gearing up for our v5.0 launch—moving from a niche tool to the platform-agnostic infrastructure that Make, Zapier, and n8n users actually need to make AI work.

Why join?

We’ve done the heavy lifting: We didn't just launch a ""wrapper"" last week. We’ve spent 5 years and 119,000+ hours building the platform.

A ""Real"" Category Leader: We’re #1 on GetApp, scoring 4.8 on G2 and 4.9 on Trustpilot with 15,000+ customers across 140 countries.

Focus over Fluff: We aren't trying to boil the ocean. We’re winning the E-commerce and RevOps markets first. You’ll have a clear ""beachhead"" to attack with specific playbooks that solve real headaches for real people.

The ""Ground Floor"" of the AI Era: Everyone is talking about AI agents, but they’re all hitting a data wall. You’ll be selling the ""missing context layer"" that makes the whole thing possible. It’s a chance to build the foundation, not just another app.

If you have SaaS experience and want to sell a solution to a problem that every Enterprise or larger team is currently facing, let’s talk.

A největší brzda? Chybějící nebo špatné EAN kódy. 🫠

Bez nich jste pro marketplace i srovnávače neviditelní. Vypadá to jako drobnost, ale ve velkém objemu je to pro firmu „datové peklo“.

Nedávno jsme tohle řešili u klienta, kde data létala z ERP, e-shopu i od tří dodavatelů najednou. Každý pes, jiná ves. Výsledek? Tým trávil dny ručním dohledáváním kódů v Excelu, místo aby prodával.

Jak jsme to vyřešili přes Boost.space?

1️⃣ Sběr: Napojili jsme všechny zdroje (ERP, PIM i surové feedy dodavatelů).

2️⃣ Logika: Nastavili jsme pravidla, která automaticky dohledají chybějící EAN a spárují ho k produktu podle referencí. Boost.space hlídá „zdroj pravdy“.

3️⃣ Distribuce: Čistá a kompletní data tečou dál – k dealerům, na Alzu, Allegro i do účetnictví. Automaticky a v reálném čase.

EAN není jen číslo. Je to propustka k růstu. Pokud vaše data víc brzdí, než jedou, je čas na systém, ne na další tabulku. 🚀

🔸How collision-avoidance systems intervened in real time

TCAS operates quietly in the background of global aviation, yet it plays a critical role in preventing mid-air collisions. This new view offers a rare, data-driven look into how often - and how effectively - these systems are working.

An aircraft labeled “VANCE 1” appeared on at least one public flight-tracking platform and seemed to trace a carefully choreographed pattern over Mar-a-Lago. The image was reportedly created by injecting false ADS-B data and manipulating reported altitudes to “draw” a picture over time — even making it appear as if Air Force One was involved.

It looked real.
But it wasn’t.

This kind of spoofing highlights a fundamental challenge in aviation data today: traditional flight tracking networks rely on unauthenticated broadcasts that can be injected, replayed, or manipulated.

GPS spoofing at the satellite level is a threat no system can fully stop — but with Wingbits’ secure, high-precision devices, attempts to feed false positions into the network become far more difficult.

Aviation data only works when it can be trusted.",,"activity","urn:li:share:7422692382657118208","2025-11-22","Valid 7422692384007917569",,"","ACwAABPyHvUBoRGu35H1vISg9nePxoithEWx68A","ACwAABPy","✅ Record Found","true","Response",true

Yes, but no.

Pilots have experienced it firsthand: GPS interference forcing crews onto backup navigation systems, disrupting runway operations and straining air traffic control. 

Over the past two years, GPS interference has increased in both frequency and scale, affecting thousands of flights worldwide. What was once a rare technical issue is becoming a recurring operational risk driven by interference, jamming, and spoofing.

The implications go far beyond aviation. GPS underpins power grids, financial systems, telecommunications, and emergency services. Yet the system was never designed to withstand sustained disruption. When positioning data becomes unreliable, the impact is immediate and widespread.

Spoofing in action: one Wingbits screenshot shows an airplane seemingly “jumping” from Romania to the Black Sea, a clear example of satellite signal spoofing that could confuse operators relying only on GPS.

For aviation, the takeaway is clear: resilience depends on visibility, verification, and redundancy.

While no network can prevent sophisticated GPS spoofing at the satellite source, Wingbits’ highly accurate, tamper-resistant receivers make it significantly harder for bad actors to inject false positions into the network.

Today, software is cheap, fast, and easy to copy. The harder part — and the real advantage — is building physical infrastructure and pairing it with a data layer that actually gets smarter over time.

We’ve seen this play out before:

-Weather data mattered once sensors were everywhere

-Waze worked because drivers became live sensors

-AIS, ADS-B, seismic networks all follow the same rule: coverage first, software second

-That’s how Wingbits is built.

We operate a decentralized network of modular ground stations that capture data others simply can’t replicate— in traditional terrestrial blindspots and in low level environments. 

On top of it, we’re building an AI-driven data layer that keeps evolving:

Continuously enriching and validating raw data

Surfacing patterns, anomalies, and context

Improving as the network grows, not just when code ships

- Helipad capacity is limited.
- Crew rotations are tight.
 -Weather + maintenance = cascading delays & unused lift capacity.

And most operators still piece together competitor + rig activity manually.

With Wingbits’ deep coverage across the Gulf, we’re now piloting AI that flags lift-capacity shifts in real time, so operators can react faster, price smarter, and capture upside the moment supply tightens.

Think like:
 🚨 “Competitor aircraft offline near Rig X — local capacity reduced.”
 🚨 “Two S-92s grounded at Galveston — back-to-back crew rotations now under-served for the next 48hrs.”
 🚨 “New competitor aircraft repositioned into Houma — regional capacity up ~18%, pricing pressure likely.”

Not “ask the AI a question.”
Let AI tell you when money-relevant conditions change.

The short video below shows just one day of helicopter traffic across Gulf rigs tracked via Wingbits.

If you work in offshore aviation, I’d love your take 👇
Are these real pain points in day-to-day ops — and would early capacity signals like this actually move the needle?

Shout-out to some of the key operators shaping offshore helicopter operations in the region, including companies like:
 Bristow Group
 PHI Aviation
 CHC Helicopter
 Sicher Helicopters
 Babcock International Group
 NHV Group

Better detail around airports: Our receivers are unique to Wingbits, allowing us to capture low-altitude and surface activity that’s often missed near airports.

Stronger coverage where others are thin: We see clear gains in South America, MENA, and Southeast Asia, driven by an incentive model that fills real data gaps.

Coverage when you need it: For enterprise customers, we can deploy targeted coverage in specific regions in days, not months.

Mi peor experiencia como inversor no fue perder dinero.
Fue no confiar en mi intuición.

Oportunidades que, sobre el papel, eran impecables:
buena oportunidad, buen timing, equipo sólido, tracción clara.

Todo cuadraba… salvo una cosa.

No había feeling con el fundador o la fundadora.
La comunicación no fluía.
Percibía falta de transparencia.
Algo no encajaba.

Y aun así invertí.
Por ser demasiado racional.
Por ignorar esa voz interior que te dice “aquí no”.

Cada vez que he hecho eso, ha salido mal.

Con el tiempo entendí que invertir no es solo aplicar criterios objetivos.
Eso es necesario, pero no suficiente.

Hay cosas que no salen en ninguna matriz:
la alineación de valores, de intereses, de formas de trabajar.
Y cuando esa alineación no existe, aunque todo lo demás tenga sentido, no hay que invertir.

Por eso hoy mi forma de invertir es muy distinta.

Me explicó que cuando un niño se siente solo o no tiene con quién jugar, se sienta ahí. Los demás lo ven… y van a invitarlo a jugar. Sin avisos. Sin preguntas incómodas.

Le pregunté si alguna vez lo había usado. Sonrió y me dijo que sí, cuando era nuevo en la escuela. Un niño se acercó, lo invitó a jugar y ese día dejó de sentirse solo.
Ahora, cuando él ve a alguien sentado allí, hace lo mismo.

La idea es simple, pero poderosa: nadie debería sentirse invisible en el recreo.
A veces, un banco no es solo un lugar para sentarse.
A veces, es el inicio de una amistad.

2025 has been an intense year at Zynap. A year of focus, fast decisions, and a strong commitment to building things properly. It’s also been a year that confirmed something we’ve believed from the start: cybersecurity needs to change. In a shorter time than we initially expected, we’ve moved fast. We’ve earned the trust of demanding organizations, the product has evolved at a great pace, and AI has clearly played a key role in that progress. Most importantly, the team has grown into a solid, thoughtful group of people who genuinely care about what we’re building.

Industry recognition and awards have been especially meaningful. Not because of the spotlight, but because they reinforce an idea we strongly believe in: less reaction, more intelligence; less noise, more context. None of this happens by accident. It’s the result of a team that pays attention to detail, challenges assumptions, and cares about doing things well. To everyone at Zynap: thank you!

I also want to thank our investors for their continued trust, especially Kibo Ventures, Kfund, Pedro Castillo, and the rest of our shareholders, for doubling down on the company and extending the round to €12M. That trust matters, and we take the responsibility that comes with it very seriously.

We head into 2026 with calm ambition. Focused on building a stronger product, growing with intention, and continuing to rethink how cybersecurity is built and operated. Thank you to our customers, partners, and investors for the trust.

This isn’t just another funding announcement, it’s fuel to keep pushing a very clear mission forward: cybersecurity can’t stay reactive anymore. We need prevention, intelligence and action before an attack lands. That’s exactly what we’re building.

Over the last year, working side-by-side with customers, one thing stands out: the future belongs to teams that collaborate, break silos and think beyond their own box. Only by unifying intelligence, offensive security and operations we’ll be capable of outsmarting cybercrime.

A huge thank you to Juan L. Santamaría, Aquilino Peña, Javier Torremocha, Covadonga García-Valdés and the Kibo Ventures team, and to Miguel A., Jaime Novoa, Jorge Campo and the Kfund family for believing in this vision and pushing us to go further. Partnerships like this don’t just add capital. They add brains, honesty and people who truly care about the journey.

And to the entire Zynap crew: I couldn’t be prouder. The magic happens because you work together, challenge each other, help each other, and push in the same direction. Zero ego, zero silos. Just a shared obsession to build something big.

Here is the challenge we have identified: 

1️⃣ Most businesses started off by deploying AI offered from an existing incumbent provider. This was typically a generic/horizontal solution. The dream was sold, the reality very different

2️⃣ Deep domain activities and tasks were not executed with the right precision or context

3️⃣ Adoption was low and value wasn't delivered

4️⃣ But it wasn't just the technology, it was also the fact that behaviours didn't change

5️⃣ Teams hit a roadblock

What next?

The companies seeing real ROI are not the ones with the most AI. They are the ones with the most focused AI. Vertical. Workflow-specific. With intentional change baked in from day one.

I am pleased to share that Covecta and Finova have announced a new partnership. A lot of partnership announcements are fairly shallow. This one isn’t.

For years, innovation within financial institutions meant migrating off an old system and onto a new one. This carried risk and cost, with business case benefits often not being realised. 🛑  
For the last 12 months I have been saying this will change. That time has now come. ⏩ 

Covecta’s agents are now embedded and powering AI capabilities within Finova’s platform, starting initially with the broker portals and then onto the lending & origination capabilities. 

The best of SaaS with the best of AI.

Our first live solution is Finova Broker Assist. A capability that enriches the broker experience with conversational AI against policies and other lender information within your Finova broker portal.

> Why is this important?

Finova’s customers can continue to benefit from a leading broker and origination platform that powers 20% of mortgage originations 🤯  in the UK, whilst also accessing Covecta’s expert AI agents for your critical workflows and activities. 

I mean, come on. What is there to not like about this?

1️⃣ No migration
2️⃣ Instant access to proven AI innovation
3️⃣ Your AI needs can be accessed through existing contractual relationships with Finova
4️⃣ Low risk, with upside value

Covecta and Finova are advancing the way technology, especially agentic innovation is built, deployed and consumed across the financial services sector.
 
You can be live by the end of Q1 2026. Yes 2026, not 2027.

But only 8.6% of enterprises have AI agents in production.

The headlines paint a different picture. JPMorgan has 400+ use cases. BNY is building ""digital employees.""

McKinsey now has 60,000 employees - 25,000 are AI Agents.

So where's the disconnect?

Most institutions are trapped in what I call ""pilot purgatory"" - endless experimentation, limited production value.

The technology isn't the blocker. Agentic AI can genuinely reason through multi-step workflows, handle exceptions and adapt to context.

Integration is.

60% of AI leaders cite legacy systems as their primary barrier. In financial services, those systems aren't just outdated - they're woven into regulatory processes, risk frameworks and compliance workflows built over decades.

Generic AI platforms stumble on this complexity. They can't distinguish why a flagged transaction needs different handling in AML vs fraud contexts. They miss the nuance between jurisdictional requirements.

The institutions breaking through aren't throwing more compute at the problem.

They're selecting platforms purpose-built for financial services - tools that understand the domain, not just the data.

What's been the biggest barrier for your team moving AI from pilot to production?

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417485196436045824","Yes","The reason we feel friction when using AI is that we’re still approaching it like traditional software. Seamless adoption requires three changes in how we work:

1/ Get comfortable working conversationally. Instead of asking a question and getting an answer, we need to complete tasks through dialogue. That means letting the AI ask questions back to refine and improve the output. Treat it like a colleague, not a search engine.

2/ Learn how to communicate intent. Prompting isn’t that different from managing a team. You have to get better at expressing what you want so you get the outcome you’re looking for. With AI, the key is context: your prompt needs enough information for the model to produce a complete answer. The challenge with out-of-the-box solutions is they don’t know your world, so you compensate with more direction. The more specialised the system, the more context is baked in, and the less you need to explain yourself.

3/ Accept that most AI systems aren’t deterministic. Ask the same thing twice and you won’t always get the same result. To trust the outcome, you need to understand how it was produced and what it was based on. That means putting guardrails in place so the AI can surface the sources and reasoning behind its answer.

None of this is particularly complicated, but it is a different way of using software than most of us are used to.

What is useful is what people building AI systems are actually focusing on right now.

For most organisations, especially in financial services, the real problem is a lack of systems that can reason through messy, day-to-day work - exceptions, judgement calls, incomplete data sets, and non-standard processes.

That’s where existing SaaS tools struggle. Not because they’re bad products, but because they were never designed for that kind of work.

On the other hand, agentic systems are. They operate inside defined domains, reason in context, and handle variation without everything breaking.

That’s why this phase of AI is likely to last. It’s not a stepping stone people rush through to reach AGI but solving the real operational challenges where businesses see value.

Some firms are already investing in foundations, data, and operating models that assume agents will be part of the workflow. 

For those who haven’t, you probably still have time. But waiting doesn’t freeze the field, it just means others are learning faster.

In most industries, the next decade won’t be defined by who “cracked” AGI. It’ll be defined by who figured out how to use agents well.","Scott Wilson","activity","urn:li:share:7415818940435890176","2025-11-22","Valid 7417105192481067008","ACoAAA4BwnsB9TsGDLNf2gmcrn07Kdg1rUlBKA8","ACwAAA4B","ACwAAA4BwnsBECnTXMdaknbHFYPsibKWZqdbe4Y","ACwAAA4B","✅ Record Found","true",,false

He walked me through their current reality, and honestly, it's challenging.

I'm meeting with manufacturing companies, big and small, every week. The story is always the same:

- Margins under pressure.
- Geopolitical uncertainty.
- Tariffs constantly shifting.
- European labor costs that make Asian competition look unbeatable.
- Regulations stacking up faster than they can handle.

This is the engine of the European industry. There are thousands of companies dependent on this sector doing well, upstream and downstream.

Interestingly enough, their production floor is cutting edge. Robots, automation, IoT sensors - millions invested in the latest manufacturing tech. Walk through the factory and it's genuinely impressive.

Their office? Running like it's 1985.

People manually typing data between systems. Copy-pasting. The same administrative grind that's been around for forty years.

The factory runs on robots. The office runs on humans doing robot work.

This is where I think AI actually changes things. Not because it's magic, but because it can read messy data, understand context, and take action across systems without needing everything perfectly structured first.

Each shipment generates 5-8 documents that need to match each other perfectly. 

Every company that makes, moves, or sells physical goods is still manually checking and matching these documents with each other and their ERP data.

Why does this still happen in 2026?

Because these documents arrive in different formats (PDFs, scans, emails), from different parties (suppliers, freight forwarders, customs), at different times. And they never match perfectly - same product, different descriptions.

Companies have tried to automate this for years. It failed because traditional systems can't handle the variation. Rules-based software needs exact matches. Reality doesn't work that way.

Someone (often an entire team) has to verify they all match. Line by line. 

Delays due to discrepancies.

Beyond the ridiculous politics, this is a sign for every company to prepare for a world of uncertainty.

Margin pressure is real.

Imagine being a low-margin manufacturing company selling goods into the US. You're underwater from one day to the next.

While everyone panics about tariffs they can't control, most companies ignore the operational waste they CAN control.

Manual processes. Disconnected ERP systems. Email chaos. These aren't minor inefficiencies - they're costing serious money every single day.

The companies that survive this aren't just absorbing tariffs.

McKinsey & Company just published research that perfectly aligns with what we're seeing in manufacturing, wholesale, and logistics.

The problem isn't AI capability. It's what they call the ""great divide.""

Companies are pouring resources into AI agents while their ERP systems - the foundation that holds their business logic, clean data, and workflows - deteriorate from neglect.

The numbers are brutal: only 40% of companies see any EBIT impact from AI.

Look at the image I've shared. Nearly every critical business domain relies on ERP as either a core or partial system.

And here's where it gets real for operational teams:

The highest-impact use cases we see are ALL deeply connected to ERP:

→ Order processing: AI reads orders, validates against inventory and creates order confirmations, flags exceptions - all pulling from and writing back to ERP master data

→ Invoice processing: AI extracts invoice data, matches to POs, routes approvals - but only works when your ERP's vendor data and approval workflows are clean

→ Quote generation: AI creates quotes based on pricing rules, available capacity, lead times - all live data that exists in your ERP

→ Production planning: AI optimizes schedules considering materials, machine capacity, delivery dates - every single input comes from ERP tables

These aren't standalone AI tools. They're intelligent extensions of your ERP workflows.

McKinsey found that the companies achieving real impact focus on redesigning workflows at the domain level. Exactly where ERP and AI must work together.

This is our thesis at Lleverage. AI solutions for companies that make, move, or sell physical products deeply integrated into your ERP.

We're not replacing ERPs with AI. We're automating your manual processes.

Handmatige orderverwerking kost maakbedrijven 20-40% van hun operationele capaciteit. 

- Order informatie halen uit PDF's, e-mails en portals. 
- Informatie overtypen in het ERP-systeem. 
- Ontbrekende gegevens opvragen. 
- Menselijke fouten die kostbare vertragingen veroorzaken.

De meeste bedrijven accepteren dit als onvermijdelijke overhead. Maar AI kan het elimineren - zonder je ERP te vervangen of je team opnieuw te trainen.

Zie hoe Nederlandse maak- en handelsbedrijven hun volledige order flow automatiseren, teams vrijmaken en fouten elimineren.

Wat er aan bod komt:
De verborgen kosten van handmatige orderverwerking - Waarom dit knelpunt alles beïnvloedt, van cashflow tot klanttevredenheid

Echte cases - Hoe bedrijven 70-80% van de order entry automatiseerden en verwerkingstijd terugbrachten van uren naar minuten

AI die werkt met jouw systemen - Slimme data-extractie uit elk format, intelligente validatie, en naadloze ERP-integratie

Implementatie zonder verstoring - Van pilot naar productie in weken, niet maanden

What a year it's been. 
 
We started the year going through a pivot. Not the easiest decision, but absolutely the right one. 

What followed were ambitious goals and a clear vision: prove that AI solutions can truly transform operations in traditional industries. 

We raised funding from Peak who believed in the vision, and haven't looked back since.

In the months that followed, we grew to 20 people, crossed important growth milestones, and moved offices... twice.

We've started collaborations with incredible clients - from Dutch family-owned businesses to large international enterprises. We've spent countless hours on factory floors, in warehouses, and in boardrooms, learning what companies that make, move, or sell physical products really need from AI.

It hasn't always been easy. Enterprise sales cycles are long, integrations are complex, pivots are challenging, and we're always learning more as we scale. But that's the work - building something real takes time, commitment, and the willingness to make tough calls.

I'm incredibly proud of our team for staying focused through all the changes on what matters: solving actual problems for our clients, building lasting relationships, and creating solutions that make a genuine difference in how businesses operate.

I've been doing some presentations lately about AI & ERPs in logistics and manufacturing.

One slide always gets the same reaction: a screenshot of a typical ERP interface. The kind that looks like it was built before the internet existed. 
Because it probably was.

The conversation that follows is always the same. Operations managers telling me their teams spend 30-50% of their day copying data between systems. 

Order info lives in the ERP. Shipment tracking in the TMS. Warehouse status somewhere else. Customer requests buried in email. Excel files holding it all together with duct tape. 

But usually, its humans acting as the glue between all systems.

Orders, finance, planning, inventory - it's all there. Connected to your TMS for transport, WMS for warehousing, CRM for customers.

But there's a dirty reality: humans are the actual integration layer.

That's what came through loud and clear in yesterday's webinar poll. When I asked manufacturing and logistics leaders ""What's your biggest ERP frustration?"", the big winner was ""Too much manual work"".

Not integration problems. Not poor data quality.

Just the reality that 30-50% of employees' time disappears into manually copying data between systems that refuse to talk to each other properly.

And this is happening at the worst possible time: Margin pressure. Geopolitical chaos. Tariffs. Rising labor costs. Tighter regulations.

Companies making, moving, and selling physical products are getting squeezed from every direction - while their people spend half the day manually copying data between systems.

AI is built to replace ""the glue"": Reads any format → Reasons through exceptions → Acts across systems

Keep your ERP. Add an intelligent layer that stops wasting human time on system translation.

Wrong order quantities. Outdated inventory. Typos in addresses. All because someone's typing it in by hand.

I see this constantly. Company's growing, orders picking up. Then it falls apart. Wrong shipments. Lost customers. Costs spiral.

Walk into any warehouse and ask what slows them down. They'll tell you - half their day is correcting upstream mistakes or re-entering information that already exists somewhere else.

This isn't a people problem. They're copying from an email into the ERP, then a spreadsheet, then the WMS or TMS. Five formats, three naming conventions. Of course mistakes happen.

When you're small, you brute force it. Someone catches errors, you reconcile manually. Painful but manageable.

Growth multiplies the problem faster than you can hire. 50 orders to 500, and that annoying error rate becomes existential.

On 25 June, Covecta will be hosting the FTT Fintech AI Transformation event in London. 

This event marks another huge milestone. We’re bringing together the leading financial institutions with AI native providers at the cutting edge of our industry - and we already have a standout agenda. 

Over the coming days, we'll be sharing more about what to expect from the event and why you should get involved. 

But first, why are we getting involved?

Scott Wilson and I have been going to FTT Fintech events for years, and the reason we keep coming back is pretty simple: they bring together the right people, in the right environment. We’ve always left with great contacts, better relationships, and a load of new insight. 

Right now, the way AI is being applied across FS still feels misaligned. 

Too much energy is going into adding features to existing SaaS tools, but the underlying problems haven’t really shifted. 

The industry is moving too slowly - work is still fragmented, decisions still take too long, and risk is still managed in ways that don’t scale.

That’s why we wanted to get behind this event. 

Our goal is to get the organisations that are genuinely rethinking how the enterprise works in one room; so banks, lenders and building societies can get clarity in one place.

This is exactly why we built Finova Broker Assist, our first solution with Finova, and the first of many examples of how this partnership will bring real value to users. 

Covecta’s agents are designed to go where the work happens, delivered through a single conversational interface, and embedded in the existing broker experience. 

Now, our conversational agents are fully deployed inside Finova’s broker portal. Brokers can securely access lender-specific policy, process and pricing guidance, with fully authenticated access. And, importantly, the data isn’t used for LLM fine-tuning or training. Contracting is also frictionless via Finova, so teams can get moving quickly.

The benefit for both sides is huge:

> Brokers get faster, more complete answers, so they can serve borrowers more quickly and place cases with the right lender first time. 

> Lenders see stronger conversion through the broker portal, less email and call traffic into contact centres, and better-quality submissions that reduce the expensive back-and-forth between broker and underwriter across origination. It also gives lenders a faster path to innovate across their broker network.

The future of financial services won’t be built on individual platforms. It will be built on ecosystems. Tech that comes together to make teams faster and more consistent, without creating a new layer of fragility and risk.

That’s why I’m genuinely delighted we’re partnering with Finova. They have a seriously strong track record in the mortgage sector.  Mortgages remain one of the UK’s most important economic engines and their platform powers around 20% of UK mortgage originations. 

For years, “innovation” inside financial institutions meant moving off one system and onto another. But this carries a high cost, high risk, and promised benefits that often arrive late or not at all - something we’ve spoken about at length in recent weeks.

With this partnership, Covecta’s expert AI agents sit inside Finova’s platform. We’re starting with the broker portals, then moving into lending and origination.

This is another step in getting agentic AI into production in places that matter, without turning transformation into a rebuild.

A massive shout-out to the Covecta team and everyone at Finova for getting this live. 

Excited to see how our partnership evolves!

Across the industry, 2025 was full of big macro bets, particularly from the hyperscalers. Some of those investments will start to pay off and others may look more questionable with hindsight. But watching those outcomes unfold will be one of the defining themes of the year ahead.

At the enterprise level, I see two priorities rising to the top:

1/ Pushing agent autonomy further.

We made real progress in 2025, but the heavy lifting is still ahead. Teams are only just starting to break away from manual workflows. The gap between a helpful assistant and a genuinely autonomous agent is wider than the headlines suggest, and that journey will continue right through 2026.

2/ The growing weight of financial crime.

Every institution I speak to is feeling the same pressure: higher regulatory expectations, more complex cases, and rising operational burden. It’s a space where spend, scrutiny and urgency are all increasing. That trend won’t slow down.

Innovation in our sector is moving quickly. New capabilities are coming to market faster than most institutions expected. And every year brings surprises - usually in the places we weren’t forecasting.

2026 won’t be straightforward, but it will be a year where the industry learns a lot very quickly and we’ll be leading the charge at Covecta. Looking forward to the meaningful progress ahead.

Count the users > Buy the licences > Hope adoption catches up.

I’ve sat in more steering committees than I can remember where the conversation drifted from value to utilisation. Not because the product was bad, but because the commercial model assumed people would change how they work simply because access had been paid for.

When we started building Covecta’s agents, it was obvious that a traditional SaaS pricing model didn’t fit what we were asking the technology to do. Agents aren’t passive tools. They don’t sit on a shelf waiting to be clicked. 

So we flipped the model.

Instead of charging for seats or licences, we price based on consumption. On what the agents actually do and on the value they deliver.

That changes adoption because teams don’t need a big upfront commitment just to get started. There’s no anxiety about “who gets a licence” or whether adoption justifies the spend. Anyone can use the agents, and usage finds its own level.

The impact is that you can see where the agents have real pull, like which workflows are really being used. Then those areas can be doubled down on. Others quietly fall away.

The commercial side aligns as well. Customers only pay more when the agents are doing more work, rather than for packaged features that they never use.

As usage increases the cost rises, but always in proportion to value created.

And that feels like the right direction for this next phase of enterprise technology. Less focus on access. More focus on outcomes. 

It also forces discipline on our side. If our agents aren’t delivering, we don’t get paid more. There’s nowhere to hide behind shelfware or long contracts.

As agents become a common part of how work gets done in financial services and elsewhere, the old commercial assumptions from the SaaS industry will start to look increasingly out of place.

Paying for software made sense when software just sat there.
Paying for work being done feels like the future.","Ben Thomas","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7416753530784505856","2025-11-22","Valid 7416753530784505856","ACoAAAa2EVIBesKYU6qxMD6uQ-woqwBGJzdLcJQ","ACwAAAa2","ACwAAAa2EVIBkOfWFyAllFGR8ql_e1ld2FRl-RM","ACwAAAa2","✅ Record Found","true",,false

On paper, the DIY route looks tempting. The AI tooling ecosystem is powerful: models, orchestration layers, and workflow builders are all readily available.

But the constraint isn’t tools. It’s time and focus.

Building means sourcing scarce engineering talent, aligning them to lending-specific workflows, and maintaining the system as the business evolves. The effort compounds quickly.

Alternatively, you can save yourself the stress and work with a provider with domain expertise, like Covecta.

Our agents come with decades of context and understanding already built in. They understand credit and lending workflows straight out of the box, which means customers can go live faster than a bespoke build would allow, with the kind of knowledge you’d normally expect from a team of seasoned bankers.

And while engineering time and talent are one of the biggest constraints on building in-house, they’re one of the biggest advantages of buying. Our engineering effort compounds across customers, not within a single institution. The more we grow, the more we can invest in the product, and the better it becomes for customers, without extra time or effort required on their side.

These factors fundamentally change the cost equation.

Building has its place, and we advocate it in the right areas. But for specialist agents in lending and credit, buying isn’t a shortcut. It’s usually the more rational decision.","Ben Thomas","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7414327276760141824","2025-11-22","Valid 7414327276760141824","ACoAAAa2EVIBesKYU6qxMD6uQ-woqwBGJzdLcJQ","ACwAAAa2","ACwAAAa2EVIBkOfWFyAllFGR8ql_e1ld2FRl-RM","ACwAAAa2","✅ Record Found","true",,false

The agenda to extend this tradition to climate action feels like such a hopeful next step.

So many people that work on climate and planetary health dedicate their lives to solving problems that will be felt mostly by future generations 🌍

A Climate Nobel Prize would give that work a global stage and legitimacy.

And not least, we would celebrate and highlight those that work for the common good.

Emissions keep rising, so does sea levels. It's evident that we cannot solve the problem by relying on political leadership only. The private sector must do more, can do more.

Overall, national and global media has unfortunately lost interest in climate change so we decided to make our own 'BREAKING NEWS' in Danish business media Børsen with this ad - page 5 in today's edition.

Our message is clear: We must move from competition to collaboration. 
The zero sum game approach is the road to nowhere. Instead we must come together, acknowledge our interdependence and find, fund and use solutions that move the needle.

Businesses, airlines, travel companies, sustainable aviation fuel producers, environmental organisations .. no one can alone enable us to get rid off our fossil dependency and accelerate decarbonisation in air travel. It can only be achieved as a collective. Fostering both demand and supply.

At Goodwings, we are dedicated (some might say obsessed) with driving this agenda - If you share our belief, we encourage you to talk to us, work with us, collaborate with us. The more the better. The faster we go.

But with 60+ ads, how do brands know if their ad stood out?

Last night, we ran interviews as the game aired, bringing us into the living rooms of US viewers to capture real, in-the-moment reactions.

After the game, we wanted to know which ads had stuck and sparked conversation.

A clear pattern emerged.
Memorability was closely linked to entertainment and nostalgia.

Viewers remembered stories, celebrities, jokes, and moments far more than brand names. Ads tapping into 90s and 2000s culture and familiar faces dominated recall and conversation.

In some cases, though, brands using these tactics still missed the mark. When the message drifted too far from the brand, people could vividly recount the ad but struggled to name who it was for.

Dunkin'​, Budweiser Brewing Group (AB InBev), Uber Eats, and Pringles all benefited by making the brand inseparable from the idea.

An important hire for us as we build the commercial engine to match the ambition of the product.

We’ve developed a platform that helps global shipping companies reduce unplanned off-hire and operate more predictably. It’s a complex, global industry and that’s exactly what makes the opportunity meaningful.

🔎 We’re looking for someone who:

• Has direct B2B SaaS sales experience
• Is genuinely curious and asks better questions than most
• Is comfortable engaging senior decision-makers
• Thrives in fast-moving, high-ownership environments
• Treats targets as a baseline, not the ceiling

This isn’t a “clock in, clock out” role. It’s a chance to help shape the early commercial foundations of a growing company in the maritime space.

If you’re ambitious, resilient, and want real responsibility early, let’s talk.

One of the highlights? Celebrating our Jack Petchey Award winners. Young people and adult volunteers nominated by their peers for going above and beyond. The kind of contribution that doesn’t always show up on a CV but changes lives nonetheless.

I love being asked what I did this weekend.
It’s always different. (Case in point: every photo here, taken last weekend)
I almost always start work on Monday in awe.

The challenge isn’t a lack of technology or data - it’s turning insight into commercially meaningful action. Faster decisions. Fewer surprises. Better outcomes at fleet and asset level.

That’s why the newly released 2026 Global Maritime Predictions Report from Ceto is timely. It focuses less on hype and more on the operational realities shaping the sector; from predictive maintenance to risk visibility and execution at scale.

Many of the themes closely mirror conversations I’m having right now. The winners won’t be those who digitise the most but those who operationalise the smartest.

If you’re setting strategy for 2026, it’s well worth a read.

Today’s Budget brings that tension into focus again: frozen tax thresholds, a possible shift on the two-child cap, a levy on international student fees, tweaks to business taxes. The choices are hard.

From where I sit – Scrumconnect Consulting working across key central govt departments one thing is obvious:

If we don’t modernise how services are designed and delivered, every Budget will feel like this.

We should be:

-killing wasteful legacy and manual processes
-using data and AI to target support, not just cut or add spend
-building shared platforms that drive down cost-to-serve every year
-investing in skills so departments own their futures, not just their suppliers

Tax and welfare levers matter. But operational excellence and digital discipline are where the real, sustainable savings live.

Der aktuell wieder aufflammende Zollstreit zwischen den USA und Europa (inklusive der absurden Debatten rund um Grönland) ist kein Einzelfall, sondern Teil eines größeren Musters: Handelspolitik wird zunehmend als Machtinstrument eingesetzt.

Was dabei oft übersehen wird: Die Belastung entsteht nicht nur durch die Zölle selbst, sondern durch die Unsicherheit, die sie auslösen.
Ein aktueller wirtschaftspolitischer Report des FIW zeigt, wie massiv diese Unsicherheit mittlerweile ist: Der US-Index für wirtschaftspolitische Unsicherheit erreichte 2025 ein historisches Allzeithoch. Höher als während der Finanzkrise oder der Pandemie. Gleichzeitig ist der durchschnittliche effektive US-Importzoll innerhalb weniger Monate von rund 2 % auf zeitweise fast 18 % gestiegen.
 
Das sind keine abstrakten Zahlen. Das sind Verwerfungen, die Investitionen verzögern, Lieferketten verzerren und Kosten schwer kalkulierbar machen.

Was ich in Gesprächen mit Unternehmen immer wieder sehe: Nicht die Höhe der Abgaben ist das Problem, sondern der Aufwand, die Intransparenz und die Fehleranfälligkeit dahinter. Fehlklassifizierungen kosten Geld. Schlechte Daten kosten Zeit. Beides zusammen kostet Wettbewerbsfähigkeit.
 
Die Zölle werden (vorerst) bleiben.
Geopolitische Spannungen vermutlich auch.
 
Die Frage ist also nicht, ob Unternehmen davon betroffen sind, sondern wie gut sie damit umgehen können. Genau an dieser Schnittstelle arbeiten wir bei Digicust: Nicht, um Politik zu kommentieren, sondern um Unternehmen in einem zunehmend instabilen Umfeld handlungsfähig zu halten.

Why it mattered
For many teams, the challenge wasn’t just about increasing trade; it was about dealing with the daily reality of greater complexity, tighter deadlines, greater audit pressure and less tolerance for manual errors. 

In such an environment, automation is no longer optional; it is a requirement for operational stability.
 
Against this backdrop, Digicust had a year to remember:
 
→ 10X growth
 → Germany’s market leader
 → Launched in five countries
 → Over 60 companies onboarded
 → 500,000+ customs declarations processed
 → Pre‑Series A financing round completed to accelerate scaling
 
These milestones matter because they reflect the fact that teams are choosing to modernise customs execution rather than just discussing it.

A few changes that (in my view) really matter in practice:

- No more €150 duty exemption for low-value e-commerce parcels
- CBAM moving into its operational phase for carbon-intensive imports
- A fully electronic customs environment (ICS2, AES, NCTS, Single Window, unified datasets)
- AEO as the core trusted-trader status, with “trust & check” as the next level
- CN 2026 + evolving FTAs, sanctions and Ukraine measures reshaping tariffs and origin

The companies that will be fine in 2026 are the ones that treat customs as a product: clean data, solid processes, and systems that don’t fall over when the rules change.

At Digicust, this is exactly what we’re working on: bringing agentic AI into customs - systems that don’t just “assist” but actively take over repetitive customs work within clear guardrails, while staying transparent and auditable.

This isn’t a demo environment or a concept video – it’s the same setup that’s running in production at several large forwarding companies, customs service providers and industrial companies.

The nice part: it doesn’t really matter what you throw at it – invoices, waybills, delivery notes, packing lists, etc. as PDFs, images, Excel files or structured XML / JSON / CSV. And it doesn’t matter whether you need a German import declaration, a Dutch transit declaration or a Philippine export declaration on the other side.

Le norme introdotte con la Legge di Bilancio 2026 mirano a migliorare ulteriormente le procedure di validazione delle fatture TaxFree per i viaggiatori extra-UE, snellendo le pratiche.

Gli shopper potranno presentare la propria fattura Tax Free presso qualsiasi desk o chiosco digitale presenti nei principali aeroporti internazionali in Italia.

Un’evoluzione importante.
Ma per i brand la vera domanda è: ha ancora senso basare l’esperienza su un rimborso post-acquisto?

Con STAMP il cliente non anticipa l’IVA, non fa code e non paga commissioni per recuperare quanto gli spetta.

Il Tax Free diventa parte integrante dell’esperienza di acquisto — non un passaggio separato da gestire in aeroporto.

📍Stesso o minore rischio per il retailer

STAMP vince perché:
– Mostra il prezzo reale fin dall’inizio
– Riduce l’attrito nel punto vendita
– Aumenta conversione e scontrino medio
– Restituisce il controllo al merchant

here's how to go from zero to intermediate...

some people haven't even started with Claude Code (usually a bit lost or haven't dedicated the time to get set up.) Most people use maybe 20% of what it can actually do. they run one task at a time. research? wait 5 minutes. audit a page? wait again. draft emails? more waiting.

one thread. one bottleneck. painfully slow. what you need is multi-agent orchestration. it's basically running claude code like a small team where everyone works in parallel.

there are 3 layers to this:

→ sub-agents: fire off 3 tasks simultaneously. each gets its own context window. results come back while you keep working. like hiring freelancers for specific jobs.
→ skills: reusable workflows you write once in .claude/commands/. think /commit, /review, /audit. write once, invoke forever. consistent quality every time.
→ agent teams: multiple claude instances collaborating. a lead agent breaks down the work, then frontend, backend and tests all run at the same time. like having a PM + 3 developers.

(the trick is starting simple. sub-agents in week 1. your first skill in week 2. combine them in week 3. agent teams only when you actually need true parallelism.)

By the way, one thing people often miss : token usage. sub-agents use 300-500% more tokens. agent teams can be 7x. so use haiku for simple tasks, set max_turns limits, restrict tools per agent.

the carousel above gives you the overview. but i also wrote a really detailed playbook that takes you from literally nothing to running multi-agent setups:
→ how to install claude code and authenticate (5 min setup)
→ picking your interface: terminal vs IDE extension
→ the best adoption strategy (pick one use case a day, not a grand plan)
→ all 3 orchestration layers broken down with real examples
→ building custom agents in .claude/agents/ with restricted tools
→ writing your first skill in .claude/commands/
→ chaining skills together for compound workflows
→ hooks: auto-linting, guardrails, automation glue
→ cost management (because multi-agent burns tokens fast)
→ real community setups from members running this daily
→ a 4 week roadmap from zero to intermediate

basically the guide i wish i had when i started.

want it? you know the drill:

1. 👍 like
2. 💬 comment "" /claude ""
3. 🔄 repost just to be sure

(make 100% sure we're connected)

will send it super fast (first come first serve)

 🎭🧱

350 Mitarbeitende verlieren damit nicht nur ihren Arbeitsplatz, sondern einen zentralen Teil ihrer beruflichen Identität.

Der Grund: zu hohe Produktionskosten.

Diese Nachricht trifft.
 Nicht nur wegen der Menschen dahinter – sondern weil sie ein größeres Problem sichtbar macht:
 👉 Produktionsstandorte verschwinden aus Deutschland.
 👉 Und mit ihnen Sicherheit, Know-how und Zukunft.

Produktionsstandorte sichern heißt Existenzen sichern. Punkt.
Genau das erlebe ich jeden Tag bei OMMM.

Mit OMMM.ai Produktionszeit und -kosten zu senken klingt nüchtern. Fast technisch.
In Wahrheit ist es oft der entscheidende Hebel, ob ein Werk im internationalen Wettbewerb bestehen kann – oder eben nicht.

Ob Tore offen bleiben 🚪 oder für immer schließen.
Wir müssen ehrlich sein:
Wenn wir nichts tun, werden solche Meldungen zur neuen Normalität.

Was mich antreibt – und stolz macht 💪 – ist der Tatendrang, den ich täglich sehe:
 in unserem OMMM-Team und bei unseren Kunden.
 Unternehmen, die nicht jammern, sondern handeln.
 Die KI nicht als Buzzword sehen, sondern als Werkzeug.
 Die mit Mut und klarem Kopf ihre Produktion stabilisieren – und Arbeitsplätze sichern.

Ja, diese Arbeitsplätze verändern sich.
Aber sie sichern Zukunft. 🚀

Gleichzeitig bereitet mir eines Sorgen:
Während KI auf den Agenden vieler CEOs ganz oben steht, hinkt die konkrete Umsetzung in Deutschland hinterher.

Der PwC Global CEO Survey 2025 zeigt klar:
 🌍 Weltweit entstehen messbare Effizienzgewinne durch KI.
 🇩🇪 Deutschland bleibt zurück.

Die Playmobil-Nachricht ist traurig.
Aber vielleicht ist sie auch ein Warnschuss.
Nicht für Panik.
Nicht für Angst.
Sondern für einen Moment des Innehaltens – und dann entschlossenes Handeln.

👉 Lasst uns KI jetzt so einsetzen, dass solche Schlagzeilen nicht unser Alltag werden.
 👉 Lasst uns Produktionsstandorte zukunftsfähig machen – gemeinsam.
Wer mitmachen will: Jetzt ist der Moment. 💥

Nach der Präsentation gemeinsam mit Jochen Rock und den vielen spannenden Gesprächen im Anschluss wurde eines wieder sehr deutlich:
Egal ob Süßwaren, Food oder Industrie – am Ende kommen wir immer bei denselben Herausforderungen an.

Im Kern geht es um operative Planung in einer Realität mit:
•⁠ ⁠tausenden Aufträgen pro Tag,
•⁠ ⁠unterschiedlichen Produktionslinien,
•⁠ ⁠zahlreichen Anforderungen und Restriktionen,
•⁠ ⁠begrenzten Kapazitäten und Ressourcen,
•⁠ ⁠ständig wechselnden Prioritäten –
und einer Komplexität, die rein manuell durchs menschliche Gehirn NICHT beherrschbar ist.

Genau deshalb sprechen wir bei OMMM Operations Management Solutions GmbH über KI in der operativen Planung: nicht als Buzzword, sondern als echten Hebel, um Komplexität zu meistern, Entscheidungen zu verbessern und Planung wieder handhabbar zu machen.
--> in kleinen Schritten, pragmatisch, schnell
--> lieber in 8-12 Wochen eine erste kleine Version am Start als nach 24 Monaten mit komplexer Lösung und leeren Händen.

– Bühne frei für den Veränderungstanz

Heute durfte ich auf der Taste & Talk Stage (cooles Sakko übrigens lieber David Bargiel) über eines meiner Herzensthemen sprechen:
„Veränderung verhindern: Der Tanz um das Goldene Kalb“ – natürlich mit Blick auf Künstliche Intelligenz.

8/10 Unternehmen beschäftigen sich aktuell mit KI und/oder haben bereits großangelegte KI Initiativen am Start. Doch, viele von diesen scheitern.

Warum scheitern so viele KI-Projekte?
95% lt. einer aktuellen MIT Studie.
Meist nicht an der Technologie, sondern daran den ""Faktor Mensch"" ausreichend zu berücksichtigen. Wir tanzen quasi um das Goldene Kalb KI mit unseren einstudierten Tänzen:

💃 Das „Alles-soll-so-bleiben-Ballett“
🕺 Der „Bloß-keine-Konflikte-Breakdance“
🌴 Der „Wir-ignorieren-Altlasten-Mambo“

Genau diese Muster begegnen mir täglich in meiner Arbeit bei OMMM Operations Management Solutions GmbH.
KI legt sie gnadenlos offen – und fordert uns heraus, den Takt zu wechseln.

👉 Meine Kernbotschaft: Mehr Mut – mehr Speed.
Denn ohne Mut keine echte Veränderung. Und ohne Geschwindigkeit keine Wirkung.

Danke für die tolle Energie, die klugen Fragen und den offenen Austausch!

Am 03.02 geht’s weiter mit dem nächsten Vortrag, diesmal mit Jochen Rock

We’re pumped to be a finalist for the RSAC Innovation Sandbox this March. We’re incredibly proud of what we’ve built and grateful to the security and AI leaders building alongside us every day. So much of the platform exists because of the feedback you’ve shared as agents accelerate into production. And we’ll keep moving quickly to make sure your challenges are addressed.

And it doesn’t stop there.

Geordie AI is now available on AWS Marketplace!

Now teams can get Geordie faster as agent security becomes a real priority. We kept hearing ""we want to buy through AWS,"" and now you can.

Check out our listing today, and give us a shout if you want to chat or see it in action.

Absolutely delighted to share that Geordie AI has been selected as a finalist for the prestigious RSAC Innovation Sandbox this March 🎉
(Press release in the comments)

When we started, agent adoption was in its infancy. But deep discovery with early adopters made one thing clear: Security & AI teams would need real partnership to navigate emerging agent architectures & operations, and the governance and security challenges that come with them.

We bet our careers that this shift would happen faster than most expected, and got to work with the belief that enterprises would need a partner who had built from the ground up for the realities of agents, rather than struggling to retrofit product after the fact.

That pace has been breathtaking. Today, our customers aren’t being sold a roadmap. They’re getting real, day-to-day support from a team and a platform that helps them understand, secure, and confidently adopt agents - right now. And one that moves fast to give them the confidence that they can stay ahead whilst agentic operations & infrastructure rapidly evolve.

Huge thanks to the Security & AI teams building alongside us. We will always build wholeheartedly alongside you so you can unlock the power of agents without unleashing risk. And to the incredible Geordie crew of legends: Let’s keep winning, and stay obsessed with our customers so that they can reach new heights with agents.","Henry Comfort","activity","urn:li:share:7426973356807360513","2025-11-22","Valid 7426973358270943232","ACoAABqAwTAB7pBEXvyX2QxgRSJpD0eHM6adTJQ","ACwAABqA","ACwAABqAwTABApwOgkZvbxmgVbTxmbW9GX3NOFo","ACwAABqA","✅ Record Found","true",,false

With decades of experience as CIO across Currys, Dyson & Sony, Andy has seen the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to enterprise software. His verdict on Geordie: “beautiful.” 🤩 

Jokes aside, Andy is another world-class leader in the space who got the vision early and has helped shape what we’ve built - a platform grounded in the realities of what Security & IT teams actually need as they deploy agents.

We’ve built Geordie architecturally from the ground up for the nature of agents, so that the forward-thinking teams working with us could actually understand their agentic footprint and operations, and manage the associated risk while enabling innovation.

And any trip to Boston means we had to catch up with Antonio Bovoso. 

We literally live off the feedback of security and AI teams. The core principle of everything we’ve built, and continue to build, is that it must enable organisations to succeed with agents, and deal with the realities they are facing when adopting them today.

Antonio was wrestling with exactly this early on in our journey. It was clear that no existing tools in the stack were designed for the realities of the world agents are creating.

We’ve come a long way since pre-product workshops out in a much sunnier Boston (pictured last year!)

Very quickly Antonio, like many Security & AI leaders, went from discovery calls to becoming a cherished part of the Geordie family in the process.

I can’t overstate how much it has meant to have such an amazing group of security & AI teams partner with us along the way from discovery to deployment, and now as customers.

People who come from financially unstable or challenging backgrounds often prioritize stability so much that their dreams quietly get postponed, sometimes indefinitely.
That stability feels responsible. Necessary. Safe.
But it can also become a ceiling.
One hard lesson I can share, and watched others learn slowly, is that meaningful improvement almost always requires risking some form of security. Growth rarely happens while everything stays comfortable.
The second lesson is even harder to accept.
If you are not doing as well in a field or role as you expected, staying put out of fear does not fix it. Pivoting does.
Progress comes from admitting this is not working and giving yourself permission to explore something else, even when the path is unclear.
Dreams are not figured out by waiting for certainty.
They are shaped by moving, testing, failing, and adjusting despite uncertainty.
Stability matters.
But sometimes choosing uncertainty is the most practical decision you can make.","Ali Majid","activity","urn:li:share:7426944667084075008","2025-11-22","Valid 7426944668078141440","ACoAAAn9RoEBGD1s_FlA3PfIS-NHzAl2KqtVfu0","ACwAAAn9","ACwAAAn9RoEBycJe9LprEpxKs394RaXNLuz-tkc","ACwAAAn9","✅ Record Found","false",,false

​Lately, I’m seeing too many brilliant leaders try to copy-paste their way to a win. They take what worked at a massive SaaS and try to force it into a Series A SaaS. Or they take a Fintech ""growth hack"" and expect it to work in B2B.

​It’s not working.
​In fact, the more ""polished"" and ""proven"" your strategy looks on a slide deck, the more likely it is to fail in the real world right now.
​The truth is, buyers are exhausted. They can smell a ""sequence"" from a mile away. They know when they’re being dumped into a funnel.

That’s the question we keep hearing since the draft simplified ESRS was published.

Wait for the final adoption. Wait another year before our publication in 2028.

Here’s a simple truth: postponing the inevitable is never a great idea. 
Simplified ESRS doesn’t mean “do nothing.” It means start in a simpler way.
If you’re unsure what to do, this is the path that makes sense:

This year
- Do your materiality assessment. Not a massive checklist anymore. More pragmatic.
- Prepare your ESRS report in the new format. Immediately see the gaps you have and prioritise which ones require your attention. Some clients also do a pre-assurance.

Next year
Finalise, update w the latest data & audit your report. With full confidence.

Companies who postpone will be in a rush later. It will be like climbing up that skyscraper - but not Alex Honnold-style. 
Companies who start now, take incremental steps and stay in control.

And no, starting now doesn’t mean doing things twice. 
Karomia already works with today’s simplified ESRS, so you can on the spot transpose your data into the new format and identify any remaining gaps.","Jens Verhiest","activity","urn:li:share:7421481448420831233","2025-11-22","Valid 7421481451382108160","ACoAAAQRtIkB17ubvF9In6w04GffWlMDmCu5Hbk","ACwAAAQR","ACwAAAQRtIkB_kNT9k7LkTEv9jPKH7xCX6BgpfI","ACwAAAQR","✅ Record Found","true",,false

6+ years of development. 142,253 automations built. And Boost.space v5 is almost here.

Scrolling through LinkedIn lately feels like a never-ending loop of AI hype, AI Agent buzz, and some random guy who vibe-coded a new HubSpot in 2 hours.

All jokes aside though — AI is evolving at the speed of light.

But some things will never change.

Like the fact that without a proper data foundation, ""your AI"" can only do so much. It can only see so far.

And it doesn't matter whether you're building Make automations within a small team or scaling agentic workflows across an enterprise.

AI needs context.
Automations need context.
Agents need context.

In just a few hours, we'll show you a no-code platform that's actually built for that.

👉 Scales with you
👉 Lets you use your own Make
👉 Comes with assisted onboarding in annual plans

...and so much more (really, no marketing fluff here).

You want to be there. Trust me.

Why this matters?
Most automation stacks are built as isolated scenarios. Boost.space v5 turns them into a connected system — where:
✅ Data stays persistent
✅ Context is shared
✅ AI agents build on each other’s work
✅ Workflows stack instead of breaking
✅ Automation becomes a long-term strategic asset, not a fragile hack

It took us years and over 140,000 automations sending data in and out of our databases to get this right. Now we’re finally ready to share it with the Make community.

Expansion success is 10% strategy, 90% psychology. You need people who will look you in the eye and give you the unvarnished truth, celebrating your wins but calling you out on your BS. In the loneliness of a global push, the local founder community becomes your most important board of directors.

Ask a CFO who owns the JW Marriott Venice and they’ll point to KSL Capital Partners (the Private Equity firm). They care about liability and credit risk.

But ask a Sales Rep who they need to sell to? It’s Marriott International.

This is the ""Account Hierarchy Dilemma."" 

Standard data providers (like Dun & Bradstreet) follow the money, rolling everything up to the ""Ultimate Legal Parent.""

The result? 
❌ Reps are assigned massive PE conglomerates they can't actually sell to. 
❌ ""Shadow CRMs"" emerge as reps create duplicates to bypass rigid hierarchies.
❌ Total loss of a 360° customer view.

At Delpha, we believe in Brand Supremacy. 

If it carries the brand, it should roll up to the brand—regardless of who owns the deed to the building.

We help revenue teams find the ""Commercial Truth"" by snapping hierarchies to the buying center, not the financial landlord.

Stop selling to the landlord. Start selling to the decision-maker.

“Why is Sarah calling into my account?”

Sarah thought she was prospecting a mid-market lead in Ohio.

But that “lead” was actually a subsidiary of a Global 500 owned by our Enterprise rep.

Result:
👉 2 reps frustrated

👉 1 very confused prospect

👉 territory drama + wasted cycles

👉 (and if you’re unlucky) double comp or conflicting pricing

This isn’t a people problem.

Jennifer Li from Andreessen Horowitz just nailed the biggest bottleneck for 2025: Data Entropy.

We are entering a world of Multimodal AI: where models need to ingest PDFs, emails, logs, and videos to take action. 

But here is the reality check: You cannot build a stable Multimodal future on a crumbling Structured foundation.

If your core Commercial Data (the ""Who,"" ""What,"" and ""Where"" of your customers) is decaying, your fancy new AI Agents will hallucinate. They will attach that contract PDF to the wrong ""Acme Corp"" or merge two different CEOs because the email addresses looked similar.

At Delpha, we see this every day. 
Data isn’t static. 
It decays. 
It creates chaos. 
It has high entropy.

1️⃣ Reconciles conflicts in real-time.

Behind the headline grabbing debt raises, equity raises, partner wins, team growth and loan book growth there are real stories of outcomes which matter most. Some of my highlights of 2025:

- The couple who couldn't get a mortgage due to their age realising they didn't need to sell all their investments to buy their retirement home;
- The woman who found her dream home but feared she was going to lose it if she was stuck in a chain and had too much CGT in her portfolio to use her assets but was fortunate her wealth manager worked with Firenze;
- The clients who stressed about losing a large part of their ISA allowance after taking money out of a flexisa but timings didnt quite work out for getting the money back in and found a solution through Lombard lending;
- The parents who gifted house deposits to their children without having to worry about losing access to their own assets;
- The advisor who had his biggest win of the year in a RFP against a private bank as he now had Lombard lending,
- The platform who won a huge new advisor relationship they had been prospecting for years and finally gave them an opportunity due to Lombard lending.

We studied 147 viewers watching Super Bowl ads in real-time (not out of context, not the day after, and not after the internet had its say)

The finding that stood out: Almost 3x more people recalled the entertainment than the brand

Viewers could describe celebrity moments, jokes, and storylines in vivid detail, but couldn't name who paid for it

Only 1 in 3 participants clearly recalled both the ad AND the brand

The biggest risk isn't creating a bad ad - it's creating a memorable short film with a missing sponsor

We've just announced our £3.5m funding round, which includes a strategic investment by NatWest Group, alongside a brilliant group of other investors.

This builds on a brilliant first year piloting our solution with Investec, all focused on reinventing the business overdraft for SMEs.

What's super exciting is what this represents: two of the UK's most respected banks backing a different, real problem-solving approach to flexible business finance.

For the last 20 years, banks have been pulling away from business overdrafts.

They went from 30% of SME working capital down to about 5%. And it’s understandable - unsecured lending is capital intensive, the fraud risk is real, and the operational overhead is significant.

But that left millions of businesses stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Either go to your bank and get told no, or opt for an unsecured loan and pay through the nose, ultimately adding to the cash flow problem.

Neither option was good enough and everything else seemed too complex or confusing!

So we built something different 💡

And now NatWest is coming on board to pilot the solution with their business customers. Given 1 in 5 business bank with Natwest, this partnership provides us the opportunity to make a real dent in the working capital gap and help UK businesses grow.

How did this happen?

The approach we've taken is different from most software vendors to banks and fintechs. We built a regulated payments company for businesses in conjunction with a software platform for banks - a true hybrid model.

Banks bring the balance sheet, and own have the customer relationships. Bourn brings the technology, payments and channels!

We call it ‘embedded fintech’ and we're just getting started! 

Fun Fact - Royal Bank of Scotland provided the world's first overdraft to merchant William Hog in 1728. Whilst a great working capital solution, we thought it was about time to reimagine it, in partnership with the same bank!

Digicust raised €2.3M to keep pushing our mission: taking the pain out of international trade and automating the boring (and expensive) parts properly.

With Texterous, we worked with a bunch of orgs to get AI into real operations - from big software companies to startups where AI is the core business model, automating workflows end-to-end. Lots of ""ok, but how does this run in production?"" conversations - which is exactly where it should be.

And then a totally different kind of build: we opened the residency vienna - a place for entrepreneurs to live and work together. It took off faster than we expected: thousands of applicants, some proper news coverage, and a growing group of people contributing because they genuinely want this to exist.

And all of this after finishing my masters degree at Maastricht University in February.

❌ Miljoenen euro's aan verspilde investeringen
❌ Teams die gefrustreerd achterblijven met onbruikbare systemen en nog steeds veel handmatig en repetitief werk moet doen

Het goede nieuws? Dit probleem is volledig te voorkomen met Lleverage.

In onze aankomende webinar, welke op 10 februari zal plaatsvinden, delen we: 

✓ Waarom 70% van de AI/ERP-implementaties faalt 
✓ De concrete aanpak die wél werkt 
✓ Hoe je gemiddeld €500k+ aan verspilling voorkomt

Deze inzichten zijn te belangrijk om te missen, vooral als jouw organisatie AI-integratie overweegt.

Herken jij dit probleem binnen jouw organisatie? Laat het weten in de comments. Ik heb daar ook een link naar het rapport van McKinsey en de inschrijflink voor de webinar staan.

The key is in capturing the tribal knowledge that lives in your organization, but isn't necessarily present in your ERP or in defined playbooks. 

At Lleverage, that is exactly where we focus on. The part between the email in outlook and the sales order in Business Central or SAP.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7402279151665250304","Yes","Ik kwam gisteren een interessant artikel tegen in MT/Sprout, waarin Joseph Inzerillo, de eerste Chief Digital Officer bij Salesforce, uitlegt hoe hij aankijkt tegen de implementatie van AI binnen bedrijven. 

**Spoiler** - maar raadt je zeker aan verder te lezen - 'begin klein en versnel daarna pas'. Hij komt tot deze conclusie omdat hij ziet dat veel bedrijven blijven hangen in pilots die ze niet opgeschaald krijgen of ze zijn overweldigd en weten niet waar te starten.

Enorm 'on point', al zeg ik het zelf. 

Ik beperk me voor het gemak tot bedrijven in de maakindustrie, het gros van onze klanten. Zonder uitzondering is men ontevreden over de inrichting van ERP-systemen. Neem daarbij in ogenschouw dat dit soort (familie)bedrijven van oudsher gegroeid zijn door meer mensen aan te nemen en voornamelijk een hebben gehouden op hun product(en); niet zozeer op slimme techniek in de backend of operationele processen. 

Gevolg: een gedeelte van hun werknemers richt zich voornamelijk op het in goede banen leiden van o.a. het verwerken van binnenkomende orders: e-mails in de gaten houden, order interpreteren en opzoeken in systemen, kopieer - en plakwerk verrichten, orderbevestiging eruit sturen, vragen beantwoorden cq. stellen en admin doen in het ERP etc. 

En dit is nog een eenvoudige schets van wat vaak uren of meerdere FTEs in 'beslag' neemt bij dit soort bedrijven. 

Lleverage kan dit soort 'workflows' volledig automatiseren. En vaak is dit ook laaghangend fruit: geen fouten meer, beter bedienen van klanten en mensen werk laten doen dat impact maakt. Echter, als we in gesprek gaan, komen we er vaak achter dat niet alleen orderverwerking een stuk efficiënter kan maar dat er talloze onnodige repetitieve, tijdrovende processen zijn die ook geautomatiseerd kunnen worden (eg. invoice verwerking, capacity planning, chatbot om intern direct informatie op te kunnen halen etc.).

In het begin van ons bestaan hebben we als een soort bulldozer direct dit soort processen opgepakt. Hierdoor ontstond er een aardverschuiving binnen het bedrijf, omdat mensen opeens 80/90% van hun werk anders moesten gaan inrichten omdat dit werd overgenomen door AI. Dat werkte niet echt zeg maar.

Learning: start met 1 of 2 workflows die de meeste ROI opleveren om zo focus te houden en bedrijven te laten wennen aan de impact die het kan maken. Hiermee ben ik het dus eens met de CDO van Salesforce. Ik wil hier alleen nog aan toevoegen dat AI alleen goed kan werken met 'humans in the loop', waardoor mensen de controle kunnen houden, terwijl AI het 'domme werk' doet.","Boudewijn Dekker","activity","urn:li:share:7402279150411063296","2025-11-22","Valid 7402279151665250304","ACoAABE2TbkB3jSolPHpxDs344ByPSHWYBf8H6o","ACwAABE2","ACwAABE2TbkBJKzbiU49INRMuhkmfU0C9833RJk","ACwAABE2","✅ Record Found","false",,false

Deze vraag lijkt zo'n vraag waarbij je een lastig antwoord verwacht. Zo'n vraag waarbij je overvallen kan worden tijdens een spelletje waarbij je kennis getest wordt. En misschien heb je stiekem al wat Trivial Pursuit kaartjes gelezen, ter voorbereiding om tijdens de kerst dit keer wél van je naaste(n) te winnen, maar zo'n vaart loopt het gelukkig niet om hier een goed antwoord op te formuleren. 

Het antwoord is namelijk vrij simpel, voor ons althans. Sterker nog, we zijn nieyt alleen bereid om dat antwoord te delen maar geven het graag een presenteerblaadje. Niet ik dit keer, maar onze eigen Tom van Wees van Lleverage doet z'n witte handschoenen aan, zodat je zorgeloos de feestdagen in kan. 

Hier heb je in ieder geval alvast een voorproefje, ofwel de amuse van de oplossing die we in onze webinar gaan behandelen:

We gaan het hebben over ERP-systemen (in de kern enorm verouderd en niet schaalbaar), handmatige data-invoer en gefragmenteerde IT-landschappen. Elke wijziging om het ERP heen vraagt consultants, tijd en budget. Migratie voelt te risicovol en te duur. Dat is wat we zien bij bedrijven in de maakindustrie, logistiek en groothandels.

Maarrrr, AI kan hierbij helpen. Bijvoorbeeld via een intelligente tussenlaag die je systemen verbindt, data begrijpt in elk format, en zo medewerkers een hoop tijd teruggeeft.

Ontdek hoe bedrijven hun operatie transformeren zonder migratie, zonder maanden training, en met meetbare ROI binnen weken.

We gaan het hebben over waarom traditionele oplossingen niet werken en AI wél het verschil maakt. We behandelen daarnaast concrete use cases vanuit ons portfolio. Denk hierbij aan het automatiseren van orderverwerking (spoiler alert: besparing van 7 FTE en 50% van additionele administratieve rompslomp). Verder zullen we wat dieper ingaan op hoe je via AI je gemakkelijk je data kan mappen vanuit elk format, slimme communicatie tussen al je interne data kan optuigen (60-80% minder handmatig werk als resultaat) en hoe je andere processen kan automatiseren.

Als dit niet als muziek in de oren klinkt, zo net voor de feestdagen, weet ik het ook niet meer.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7429887440355577856","Yes","Somewhere between meetings and the ride home, something clicked for me.
I think experience is massively overrated in sales.

Yesterday I had a conversation with a former AE of mine. We talked about career paths and deals won, deals lost, promotions, setbacks.

And somewhere in that conversation, something clicked again for me: most people accumulate experience. Very few accumulate insight (""Erkenntnis"" in german, hard to translate it correctly).
In philosophy, there’s this idea that knowledge doesn’t come from events themselves, but it comes from examining the assumptions behind them.

I’ve carried that thought with me for years.

Because I’ve seen reps with “5 years of enterprise experience” who essentially repeated the same year five times. And I’ve seen others who lost one meaningful deal and completely changed how they think.

The difference isn’t intelligence, instead it’s reflection. Reflection is sometimes hard, the more easy/lazy way seems to not reflect permanently.

After almost every meaningful discussion I try to ask my team one question:
“If this happens again, what do we now see differently?”

Not: ""What went well?"", or ""What went wrong?"", or ""Who dropped the ball?""
But: ""What belief failed?"", ""What pattern did we misread?"", ""What does this permanently change in how we behave?""

And from my point of view I see the uncomfortable truth: Most sales organizations scale activity. Very few scale learning.

Revenue grows because your mental models improve and it doesn´t because you run more calls. If after 50 deals your thinking hasn’t evolved, your results eventually won’t either.

Experience doesn’t compound. Corrected assumptions do.

And as a leader, my job isn’t to provide answers. It’s to create an environment where beliefs get challenged and sharper thinking becomes the norm.
That’s what actually scales.","Sebastian Walter","activity","urn:li:share:7429870451398438912","2025-11-22","Valid 7429887440355577856","ACoAAC9jKsQB28Fqavsibo7FJXG85kwJ_i65u50","ACwAAC9j","ACwAAC9jKsQBlcl0_RNvjctbfb2cV9Uf3Ky08fY","ACwAAC9j","✅ Record Found","true",,false
,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427256337035722752","Yes","Low conversion rates trigger a very predictable reflex. Pipeline is weak. So the answer becomes: add more.

This means: More meetings, more demos, more deals in the CRM. On paper (or digital), this looks like progress, but in reality, it usually isn’t.

Because the problem is rarely pipeline.
What I see instead: AEs juggling 40, 50, sometimes 60 opportunities at the same time.
Not because that’s a strategy, but because prioritization quietly disappears.

At that point, conversion doesn’t drop because people suddenly forgot how to sell. Instead it drops because attention gets diluted.

There’s a limit to how many deals you can actually move forward well. From experience, that number is around 25–30.

Above that:
- deal progression becomes sloppy
- next steps lose clarity
- stakeholders aren’t really mapped
- momentum fades, slowly and unnoticed

Low conversion doesn’t automatically mean “we need more pipeline”. More often it means: we’re working the wrong deals, or too many of them, without actively managing the middle of the funnel.

More pipeline won’t fix that, but more focus will.

So you should master the middle and protect it from overload.

The biggest insight surprised even me:
It wasn’t motivation, more pressure or even “asking for more pipeline”.

What was missing was one simple, repeatable structure.

Before: Everyone was selling. Smart people. Good intent.
But everyone in their own way.

What we changed wasn’t dramatic:
- A clear, repeatable sales process
- Fewer priorities
- Less noise
- More focus on doing the right things consistently

And very consciously, I decided not to do what many expect in the first month: 
- No push for “more deals”
- No demand for “more pipeline”
- No pressure disguised as ambition

Instead:
Less, but done properly. Fewer deals, better qualified. Fewer motions, clearer ownership.

Scale doesn’t start with intensity. It starts with clarity.

Especially in Series A / B environments, leadership often isn’t about adding more and more. It is about removing what doesn’t matter.

Over the last weeks I’ve been reminded what that really means.

Some days it’s about standing in front of C-level executives and partners, pressure-testing the story and the market pull.
Other days it’s about being inside the team: rolling out processes, tightening forecasting, coaching AEs and SDRs so clarity replaces noise.

And then there are the days on the ground: on-site with customers, seeing where products are actually used and where assumptions quietly fall apart.

Somewhere in between, the role shifts again: enabling team leads, creating cadence, and making sure momentum doesn’t depend on heroics.

Scaling doesn’t mean stepping away from the field. It means choosing deliberately when to lead from the front, when to coach from the side, and when to get out of the way.

• Bringing real commitment back into deals
• Being brutally honest about pipeline quality
• Defining what must happen before a deal moves forward

Most importantly: We aligned on what changes immediately and not in 3-6 months.

Starting Monday:
• Clear qualification standards
• Fewer deals, higher conviction
• Tighter execution across SDR → AE → Marketing
• No progress without ownership

And yes for sure we also went for a tasty pizza (never had such a bad ordering process tbh :D) experience, had lunch together, and built real momentum as a team. Because performance follows trust, not the other way around.

Because quarter-end creates pressure and pressure reveals truth.
On the buyer side, things suddenly move. Decisions that were on hold start to unblock. Topics that felt complex or unpredictable become concrete.

On the sales side, quarter-end is a stress test. Not for effort but for deal qualification and deal quality.

What tends to show up:
Deals that were hope-based suddenly need miracles.
“Champions” who sounded supportive become silent.
Value that felt obvious turns out to be poorly understood or unproven.
More escalation on prospect side but less ownership.

None of these problems start in the last two weeks of the quarter. They don’t appear out of nowhere.
They are built or avoided in the middle of the funnel.

That’s why strong quarter-ends feel boring. Because clarity, ownership and proof were handled long before urgency arrived.

And before anyone asks: yes - this is a theoretical, meta-level post. An ideal scenario.
But in my experience, the closer reality gets to this model, the calmer and more predictable quarter-end becomes.

Where do you see quarter-end pressure revealing the most friction in your deals?

Someone had a problem? I fixed it. Fast. It felt good, but it made everything worse.

Because the more problems I solved, the more problems came back to me.
At some point I realized: When you solve everything, people stop solving anything.

So I changed my approach. In my weekly 1:1s we started using a simple scale:

🟢 Level 1 “I’m annoyed.” → You just want me to listen.
🟡 Level 2 “I’m stuck.” → You want a sparring partner.
🔴 Level 3 “I can’t move forward.” → That’s when I unblock.

This one shift changed everything.

Most people don’t need a fixer. They need a leader who listens first and steps in only when it truly matters.

Fixing is easy. Enabling is leadership.

Are you more of a Fixer or an Enabler (or something in between)?

There’s a surprisingly naive assumption in many sales teams, even seasoned ones: “If we get the meeting and nail the demo, the rest will take care of itself.”

This belief is responsible for more lost enterprise deals than any objection ever spoken. 

Because the middle of the funnel is not a step: it’s the enterprise playground.

Here’s what actually happens there:
Stakeholders surface (and disappear)
Political dynamics shift
Champions are tested
Risk becomes visible
Priorities change
The business case gets challenged
Internal narratives form with or without you

This is the part where sellers who rely on “product strength” lose, and sellers who understand organizational behavior win.

Enterprise buyers don’t buy features. They buy alignment, predictability and low internal risk.

The teams who understand this win bigger and faster. The teams who don’t… confuse movement with progress.

Master the middle. It’s where everything actually happens.

P.S. My handwriting might disqualify me from design roles, but not from winning enterprise deals. 😄

After mondays post and all the messages, one theme stuck with me again: how much seller growth shows up in the smallest moments and especially in how they follow up.

Not because they don’t try hard enough, but because they don’t see enough.
Follow-Ups aren’t reminders, they are cognition. They reveal the developmental stage a seller is operating from. 

Those are the same stages we covered in the Dreyfus Sales Maturity Model.

STAGE 1: NOVICE ""The Rule Follower""
→ Follow-Up = checking the box
“Just following up if there’s an update?”
Outcome: no momentum, low authority, easy to ignore
Why? They treat a follow-up like a task, not a value moment

STAGE 2: ADVANCED BEGINNER ""The Pattern Spotter""
→ Follow-Up = staying “top of mind”
“Just keeping us on your radar.”
Outcome: polite, empty, forgettable.
Why? They sense something is stuck, but can’t yet see why.

STAGE 3: COMPETENT ""The Model Builder""
→ Follow-Up = structured value drop
“I attached a similar project that might help you align internally.”
Outcome: relevant, adds context, slight movement
Why? They understand relevance, not dynamics.

STAGE 4: PROFICIENT ""The Pattern Interpreter""
→ Follow-Up = reducing internal friction
“I mapped the 3 biggest risks teams your size face and how others solved them.”
Outcome: mentoring, derisking, political clarity
Why? They don’t ask for updates instead they make updates possible.

STAGE 5: EXPERT ""The Decision Shaper""
→ Follow-Up = shaping the narrative
“Based on your internal dynamics, there are two likely blockers. Here’s the fastest path to alignment.”
Outcome: clarity, direction, urgency
Why? Experts shift decision logic and don’t chase status.

THE RULE OF FOLLOW-UPS AT ANY LEVEL:
Every touchpoint must contain real value:

Process Value
(next steps, decision clarity, buying-center alignment)
Context Value
(insights, benchmarks, risk patterns, political dynamics)
Relationship Value
(trust, rapport, understanding the buyer’s world)

A follow-up without value is noise; a follow-up with value is leadership.
Most sellers don’t need better templates. What they actually need is deeper perception.

What’s the most common follow-up mistake you see AEs make?

And a version of me that only exists because of the people around me.

When I joined Flip four years ago, I had already worked in the frontline-communication space. But these four years changed the way I work, the way I lead, and the way I think.
Not overnight, but step by step - with a lot of people shaping that journey.

Here’s what defined those steps:
- building a frontline-first, value-based, use-case-driven sales play (again and again)
- understanding the difference between selling software and changing work
- leading the enterprise team and stepping into RVP role
- hiring and developing Flipsters who became absolute weapons
- coaching people into wins that mattered more to me than my own
- winning deals through pattern recognition, not pressure
- learning how to stay human while being accountable
- figuring out how to grow a team and yourself at the same time

And yes: I grew in experience, perspective, and leadership. But I didn’t grow alone.

I grew because I had founders who trusted me, teammates who challenged me, AEs (Yasmine Tröndle, Kristina Nietzsch, Amelie Wernick, Robin Guttenberger, Domenic W., Maximilian Günzl, Maximilian Paetsch, Georgia Born, Sarafina Lichtenberg, and many more) who pushed me to be sharper, CSMs who made me reconsider assumptions, and colleagues who made the work better than the plan.

All while staying curious, absorbing everything, and trying to make myself, my team, and Flip better every single quarter.

And the funniest part? I only kept the shirt for the picture. The rest happened organically (the beard included).

Looking back, these 4 years shaped me professionally and personally. Not because everything went smoothly, but because so many people helped turn the hard parts into growth.

And I’m genuinely proud of the version of myself standing on the right side of that image.

Early in my career I tried to understand whether someone would thrive in a coaching-heavy, high-feedback sales environment. Experience and achievements never answered that.

One simple question did: “What if you’re wrong?”

I first ask for their assessment: “How would you evaluate this deal?” or “Why did it stall?” or “What’s your take?”

Then I follow up with: “What if you’re wrong?”

The reaction tells me everything:
🛑 Defensiveness or Justifying or Doubling down = low coachability

But when someone pauses, reflects, and says smth like:
✅ “Interesting. Let me reconsider.”; or ""I would need to understand another perspective"" = That’s where growth happens.

In modern sales, the most underrated skill isn’t confidence. It’s intellectual humility - the ability to adjust your thinking without feeling attacked.

How do you test for true coachability?

This year's theme hits home: ""Water, Energy & Climate Change: From Vision to Action.""

Too many good ideas stay ideas. What I'm most interested in at WEX is connecting with people who are ready to move beyond the talking stage.
The reality most utilities face:
✅ Infrastructure built decades ago, now under climate stress
✅ Tighter budgets, higher expectations
✅ Data everywhere, but turning it into action? That's the challenge

At HULO, we work with operators dealing with these exact issues. Water abundance doesn't require magic—it requires better stewardship of what we already have.

That means:
➡️ Detecting problems before they become expensive
➡️ Making infrastructure decisions based on real data
➡️ Taking action without ripping up streets or deploying costly new hardware

What I want to explore in Seville:
How are you tackling non-revenue water? What's working in network optimization? Where could AI fit into your existing systems without disrupting operations?
The best solutions come from open conversations and practical partnerships that actually serve communities.
Attending WEX? Send me a message. Let's grab coffee and talk about what's working—and what isn't.

Twee van onze kinderen werken bij Jumbo Supermarkten; vullen vakken, spiegelen en zorgen ervoor dat de winkel er piekfijn uitziet. Ze hebben het er naar hun zin en hun inzet werd beloond met een goed gevuld kerstpakket. Het krijgen, openen en uitpakken van het kerstpakket en het gevoel van waardering was een hoogtepunt en wat zijn ze er blij mee! Dank je wel Jumbo Supermarkten namens onze mannen.

Dit brengt ook prachtige herinneringen naar boven aan mijn eerste bedrijf Tintelingen, inmiddels onderdeel van Sligro Food Group, dat ik samen met Rik Klinkhamer opzette samen met oprecht een geweldig team. Jarenlang kregen wij het vertrouwen van werkgevers om hun kerstpakketten te verzorgen en miljoenen Tintelingen werden en worden nog altijd uitgereikt. Het kerstpakket als blijk van waardering en vaak het enige moment waarbij je als werkgever bij hele gezinnen een goede indruk kunt maken.

We zaten met Tintelingen echt in the winning mood en nu, 22 jaar na de oprichting, zit ik weer in deze zelfde energie. Met LiveDrop hebben we een relevante technologie ontwikkeld en doen we ertoe in kritische markten. Dit gevoel is onbeschrijfelijk lekker en proeft zoet na wederom een aantal jaren met de poten in de modder om het allemaal maar weer voor elkaar te krijgen. 

Niets zo leuk als ondernemen, eigenlijk voelt het als iedere dag een kerstpakket krijgen!

En leuk om dit artikel uit 2007 terug te lezen! https://lnkd.in/e8YJFyfD

Two of our children work at Jumbo Supermarkets; they stock shelves, tidy up, and make sure the store looks spick and span. They enjoy their work, and their efforts were rewarded with a well-stocked Christmas hamper. Receiving, opening, and unpacking the Christmas hamper and feeling appreciated was a highlight, and they are so happy with it! Thank you, Jumbo Supermarkets, on behalf of our men.

This also brings back wonderful memories of my first company, Tintelingen, now part of Sligro Food Group, which I set up together with Rik Klinkhamer and a truly amazing team. For years, employers trusted us to provide their Christmas hampers, and millions of Tintelingen were and still are being handed out. The Christmas hamper is a token of appreciation and often the only time when you, as an employer, can make a good impression on entire families.

We were really in the winning mood with Tintelingen, and now, 22 years after its founding, I am back in that same energy. With LiveDrop, we have developed relevant technology and are making a difference in critical markets. This feeling is indescribably wonderful and tastes sweet after another few years with our feet in the mud to get it all done again. 

Nothing beats entrepreneurship; it actually feels like getting a Christmas hamper every day!

De bedrijven die winnen, zijn de bedrijven die samenwerken.
Niet alleen intern. Maar met hun klant.

Want wie weet beter wat verkoopt…
dan degene die het uiteindelijk draagt?

Dit is de shift die de industrie nodig heeft:
👉 Van ontwerpen op alleen gevoel
👉 Naar ontwerpen met inzicht
👉 Van ‘voor je klant’
👉 Naar ‘met je klant’

Wanneer jij je klant betrekt bij het creatie- en inkoopproces, gebeurt er iets bijzonders:
✨ Je bouwt collecties die écht resoneren
✨ Je vermindert verspilling
✨ Je vergroot je marge
✨ En je creëert een community die zich gehoord voelt

Bij Fashion Swipe maken we co-creatie eenvoudig.
Je klant swipet door nieuwe items, geeft feedback en laat je zien wat werkt. Nog vóór jij bestelt 📲

Ben jij klaar om je klant onderdeel te maken van je design en inkoopproces?
Stuur ons een bericht en we laten je zien hoe co-creatie jouw volgende collectie transformeert.

You asked, we answered: clearer visibility across your entire portfolio to improve buy/sell/hold decisions. 

What's new:

🔸 Portfolio-Level Intelligence: Get a consolidated view of all assets you own in one place. Track performance across your entire portfolio, drill down to individual properties, and instantly see what's driving or dragging your returns.
🔹 Identify Underperformers: Spot which assets are impacting NOI and overall portfolio performance in real-time, so you can take action before small issues become big problems.
🔸 Dynamic ""What-If"" Scenarios: Model rent growth, capex investments, or disposition strategies at both the asset and portfolio level. 
🔹 Historical Actuals vs. Forecast: Upload actual operating data to compare against your projections. See what's truly driving results and refine your underwriting assumptions with real performance data.

No more chasing data across spreadsheets, property management systems, and colleagues. Just faster, data-driven decisions from acquisition and disposition to day-to-day operational strategy.

I'm excited to share that Work-Bench is leading Built AI’s $6M Seed round, alongside Lerer Hippeau and Timber Grove Ventures.

Commercial real estate moves hundreds of millions of dollars per day - but much of the industry still runs on brittle spreadsheets, outdated tools, and PDFs buried in inboxes.

Built AI fixes that.

🔹 Why Now

Legacy systems like Argus and Yardi weren’t built for today’s deal complexity or data fragmentation. For years, underwriting couldn’t be automated because data extraction wasn’t accurate enough. 

GenAI changed that. High-quality extraction from OMs, rent rolls, Argus files, and spreadsheets now makes instant, auditable financial models possible - a workflow shift the industry has been waiting for.

🔹 What Built AI Does

Built AI is an AI-powered financial modeling and decision-support platform that turns weeks of underwriting into minutes.

A few reasons we’re excited:
- Instant, transparent cash-flow models
- Portfolio aggregation and analysis
- Easy sharing with partners, sponsors, and brokers
- Real customers cutting multi-week analysis to minutes

🔹 The Team + Traction

Built AI is led by co-founders Natan L. (CEO) and Firoz Noordeen (COO) who combine deep RE expertise with real AI/ML horsepower.

They’re already working with leaders like Howard Hughes, CBRE, LondonMetric, and Knight Frank IM.

We're excited to help modernize how real-estate investment decisions get made ⚡️

When Firoz Noordeen and I started Built AI, our goal was simple. Replace archaic underwriting processes with technology that gives real estate professionals the speed, accuracy and insight they need to make the best decisions. Over the past year, our platform has helped investors analyse more than $70 billion of opportunities across the UK and Europe. None of this would have been possible without our clients who partnered with us early and pushed us to build something better.

This new funding allows us to expand deeper into the US market and continue developing our AI financial modelling and asset management capabilities. We are grateful to Work-Bench for leading the round, and to Lerer Hippeau, Timber Grove Ventures, Emerald Pine Capital, Jeremy Ford, and the exceptional angels and industry leaders who joined them.

A special thank you to our team. Their drive, focus and belief in the problem we are solving is what got us here.

We are just getting started. Real estate is the world’s largest asset class. The opportunity to bring intelligence, automation and clarity to every step of the investment lifecycle is massive. I am proud of what we have built and even more excited for what comes next.

What happens if something collapses, floods, burns?
But since the very beginning of Eoliann’s story, we’ve made hope a rule. 🌱

Yes, they are opposites: the worst and hope. And people often ask us how we avoid being overwhelmed by climate doomism. Our first answer is always that there’s no real alternative.

The second is: by staying together. By exchanging energy and creating moments of inspiration, so we can stay more connected to solutions than to problems - within and around us.

That’s exactly what we did over these three days in Alagna Valsesia, during our annual retreat. A moment to come together from the many places we usually work from, to take stock, to slow down, and to look at things from a different perspective. In this case: from the mountain peaks. ⛰️ 

What we saw was a team that practices the resilience it stands for - evolving as circumstances evolve, refusing simple answers to complex problems, and supporting one another on the ski slopes as much as in everything else.

We’re back recharged. Stay tuned: great things are coming!

But this photo was taken in Davos for the World Economic Forum to listen, learn, and contribute to conversations that will shape the next decade.

Here are three fresh takeaways Federico D’Albenzio and I are bringing back to Turin and that I felt like sharing here, too:

1) A time for Europe (and tech)

Today’s geopolitical tensions are opening a rare window for Europe to accelerate technological independence - the kind that builds competitiveness and security.

2) Climate doesn’t wait

Even when the agenda is dominated by geopolitics, the long-term picture is unchanged: climate risk remains a defining threat for people and economies according to the WEF Risk Report - and resilience must become a systemic strategy.

3) AI is entering a new phase

In the short term, agentic AI will be a protagonist. In the longer run, reaching AGI won’t be a straight line from today’s LLMs - it will require a paradigm shift. And China’s positioning is stronger than many still assume.

Grateful to Climate Scale-Up for inviting me to speak at “The Inflection of Intelligence” and the Deal Day, and thanks to my co-speakers: Susan Hunt Stevens, Kelly Harrison - your perspectives were energizing.

Leaving Davos, I’m bringing back a sense that, even in growing uncertainty, we can still build credible paths to climate resilience - and that’s exactly what we’re working on at Eoliann.

Can’t wait to get back to it.

E iniziamo da uno dei temi più urgenti e discussi delle ultime settimane: la COP30. La conferenza di Belém ci ha lasciato nuove promesse, vecchie sfide e tante domande aperte.
È il momento perfetto per fermarci, capire cosa è successo davvero e cosa significherà per il nostro futuro.

Nel primo appuntamento di Too Hot to Talk? parleremo proprio di questo: risultati, contraddizioni, impegni futuri e tutto ciò che la COP non mostra nei titoli.
Un incontro per confrontarci, fare chiarezza e rispondere a tutte le curiosità sul clima che cambia e sulle decisioni globali che ci riguardano da vicino.

Yesterday, the Yavrio Partner Tour was already in full swing as Phillip Dawson, Thomas Pike and I headed over to the Creative Computing Solutions office for a knowledge‑transfer session, walking through Yavrio’s latest solution and how it’s reshaping the way payments and banking live inside Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

We wrapped up the day with a fantastic dinner alongside the wonderful Laura Deadman, Jan Barratt and Justin Farmiloe, the kind of table where ERP meets fintech over good food, sharp insights, and plenty of “wait… have you thought about doing it this way?” moments.

Partnerships like this are where real innovation happens. Already excited for the next round!

Generative AI verändert grundlegend, wie Kundeninteraktion funktioniert:
Digitale Systeme reagieren nicht mehr starr, sondern verstehen Kontext, Sprache und Emotionen. 🧠 So wird die Kundenbeziehung neu definiert – in jedem digitalen Moment. 

Daten werden zu Dialogen. Nicht Segmente zählen, sondern Verhalten, Kontext und Emotion.

Banken und Versicherer können heute erstmals Empathie skalieren:
Tonfall, Inhalte und Reaktionen passen sich der konkreten Situation des Kunden an – in Beratung, Vermögensverwaltung und Schadensfällen.

Das Ergebnis: 
Weniger Eskalationen. Höhere Zufriedenheit. Messbar mehr Vertrauen. 📈

Mehr dazu in unserem kostenlosen Whitepaper. Link ist in den Kommentaren. 👇
____________________________

Trust is no longer established solely at physical touchpoints. It’s earned in every single dialogue. 🤝

Generative AI is transforming how customer interaction works:
Digital systems no longer react rigidly. They understand context, language, and emotion.🧠 
This redefines customer relationships in every digital moment.

Data becomes dialogue. What matters is no longer segments, but behavior, context, and emotion.

For the first time, banks and insurers can scale empathy:
Tone of voice, content, and responses adapt to each customer’s situation. Across advisory, wealth management, and claims.

The result: Fewer escalations. Higher satisfaction. Measurably more trust. 📈

Für Startups ist das tricky. Empfehlungen skalieren erst, wenn schon Kunden da sind.

Absurd ist, das viel etablierte Unternehmen mit grossartigen Produkten diesen Kanal kaum nutzen. 👉 Genau hier hilft hypt Firmen dabei, systematisch eine ""Referral Engine"" aufzubauen.

Klar, Referrals funktionieren nur mit einem guten Produkt. Punkt.
Wenn Menschen dein Produkt lieben, empfehlen sie ohne dass du fragst ❤️
Wenn sie es nicht mögen, helfen auch Incentives und Reminder nichts ❌

Was aber extrem viel bringt
 👉 Nudging
 👉 technische Vereinfachung
 👉 den Referral-Moment genau dann möglich machen, wenn Begeisterung da ist ✨

Thomas Bajas, Co-founder and Chief Growth Officer at Tilt Energy, explains how AI-powered demand flexibility is turning buildings into grid stabilizers without compromising comfort or usability.

What buildings can do:
Heat pumps, EV charging, and battery storage shift consumption in response to grid signals and electricity prices, cutting costs and integrating more renewables.

Scaling across Europe:
Tilt Energy already manages hundreds of sites in France with customers like Carrefour and Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield. Their goal: 1 gigawatt of flexible capacity by 2030.

As Thomas puts it: ""Our vision is to optimize electricity consumption like fitting pieces together in a game of Tetris."" This approach stabilizes the grid, cuts costs, and accelerates renewable integration at scale.

Und selbst wenn - die spannende Frage ist doch: 𝘸𝘪𝘦?

In den vergangenen Monaten haben Dr.-Ing. René Huppertz und ich mit Expert:innen und Entscheidungsträger:innen aus der Bau- und Immobilienbranche im DACH-Raum gesprochen, um genau das zu verstehen:
 👉 Was braucht es wirklich, damit BIM und LEAN in der Praxis Wirkung entfalten?

Die Antworten waren überraschend klar – und ermutigend:
▪️ BIM schafft echten Mehrwert, wenn Modelle über Planung hinaus genutzt werden
 ▪️ LEAN wirkt dann, wenn es früh beginnt und als Haltung verstanden wird (nicht als Brandlöscher)
 ▪️ Der größte Hebel liegt nicht in neuen Tools, sondern in klaren Zielen, Standards und Menschen, die Verantwortung übernehmen
 ▪️ Und dort, wo BIM & LEAN zusammen gedacht werden, entstehen Stabilität, Transparenz und bessere Zusammenarbeit

Aus diesen Gesprächen ist eine Broschüre entstanden:
 👉 𝑩𝑰𝑴 & 𝑳𝑬𝑨𝑵 2025 - 𝑬𝒊𝒏 𝑺𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒎𝒖𝒏𝒈𝒔𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒅 𝒂𝒖𝒔 𝒅𝒆𝒓 𝑷𝒓𝒂𝒙𝒊𝒔

Sie zeigt,
 – welche Erfolgsfaktoren immer wieder genannt wurden,
 – wie Leuchtturmprojekte entstehen,
 – und warum die Integration von BIM & LEAN für viele der nächste logische Schritt ist.

Wer sich mit der Frage beschäftigt, wie wir Planung und Ausführung zukunftsfähig organisieren, sollte einen Blick hineinwerfen.

Mein erstes Seminar als Leiter - und ehrlich gesagt hätte ich es mir kaum besser vorstellen können. Denn das 𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐮𝐭𝐬𝐜𝐡𝐬𝐩𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐞 𝐁𝐈𝐌 𝐱 𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐍 𝐒𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐫 war für mich persönlich und fachlich ein echtes Highlight.

Ganztägig, intensiv und mit einem extrem spannenden Teilnehmerkreis: Bauleiter, BIM-Leiter, Projektentwickler und Architekten. Viele mit ersten Berührungspunkten zu BIM oder LEAN aber genau deshalb mit umso mehr Neugier, Offenheit und Diskussionsfreude (und zum Teil etwas Skepsis in Bezug auf die jeweils andere „Welt“). Diese Mischung hat den Tag getragen.

Wir sind gemeinsam gestartet mit der theoretischen Grundlage von BIM x LEAN:
- Warum gehören beide Ansätze zusammen?
- Wo entstehen echte Synergien?
- Und wo scheitert es in der Praxis?

Und dann wurde es greifbar:
 ➡️ Meilenstein-Phasen-Planung am analogen Post-it-Board
 ➡️ LEAN erleben, diskutieren, hinterfragen

Der Transfer in die digitale Umsetzung folgte konsequent: Mit der Software von specter automation haben wir
- eine Last-Planner-Planung aufgebaut
- ein LEAN Meeting durchgeführt
- auf Störungen flexibel reagiert
- und direkt gezeigt, wie Planung, Kommunikation und Dokumentation zusammenfließen können.

Das Feedback der Teilnehmer war richtig schön und hat vor allem eines gezeigt: „Man merkt, dass das hier nicht Theorie aus dem Lehrbuch ist - sondern aus echten Projekten kommt.“

Ein großes Danke an AACHEN BUILDING EXPERTS für das Vertrauen und die Möglichkeit, dieses Seminar umzusetzen. Und ebenso ein herzliches Dankeschön an Dr.-Ing. René Huppertz - als Seminarpartner, Sparringspartner und für den starken Praxisfokus über den gesamten Tag hinweg.

Dieses erste Seminar hat mir gezeigt:
 👉 BIM x LEAN ist kein Konzept - es ist eine Haltung. Und genau die war im Raum spürbar.

Wenn man sieht, wie Vision, Nachhaltigkeit und Baupraxis auf diesem Niveau zusammenkommen, dann weiß man: Genau dafür machen wir das.

Das Projekt REWE Green Farming Berlin ist für mich persönlich eines der beeindruckendsten Bauvorhaben, die wir mit specter automation begleiten dürfen. Landwirtschaft über den Dächern der Stadt, konsequent kreislauffähig gedacht, mit einer Klarheit und Ambition umgesetzt, die ihresgleichen sucht. Was hier in Lankwitz entsteht, ist nicht weniger als ein 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐧ä𝐜𝐡𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. 🤯

Besonders begeistert mich, wie selbstverständlich hier modellbasiertes Arbeiten zum Rückgrat des Projekts geworden ist. Das 3D-Modell ist kein Beiwerk, sondern echtes Führungsinstrument - vom Holztragwerk bis zur hochkomplexen Haustechnik. Genau dort zeigt sich, welches Potenzial digitale Baustellensteuerung wirklich entfalten kann.

Mein großer Dank gilt:
REWE und dem gesamten Team für den Mut, diese Vision konsequent umzusetzen - und für die außergewöhnlich professionelle Zusammenarbeit.

Dreßler Bau GmbH als starkem Baupartner, der dieses anspruchsvolle Projekt mit enormer Kompetenz, Ruhe und Qualität realisiert.

Und ganz besonders dem specter automation Team. Ihr habt einmal mehr gezeigt, was möglich ist, wenn Technologie, Praxisnähe und Leidenschaft zusammenkommen.

Hier die Fakten zum Projekt:
👉 2.700 m² Dachfarm
👉 Bis zu 900.000 Salatmischungen pro Jahr
👉 Rund 930 Tonnen gebundenes CO₂
👉 100% Grünstrom, Abwärmenutzung, maximale Ressourceneffizienz

𝘗𝘸𝘊 Learning Collective reimagines development for the AI age.

And it's not just a slogan.

What are they doing differently?
𝟭. 𝟯𝟬 𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗱
PwC identified 30 essential skills, 15 AI technical and 15 human, that it considers critical to build an ""AI-native workforce"".

𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗻 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 (𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗶𝘁)
The Learning Collective embeds AI and technical development directly into client work, everyday interactions, diverse work experiences and real-world problem solving, so people learn by doing. Learning can no longer wait for the right time, place, role or ladder. It needs to be continuous, shared and immersive.

𝟯. 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻 + 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲
The program is grounded in PwC's belief that when people combine the power of AI with their human critical thinking, empathy and creativity skills, clients experience greater value.

The problem isn't technological. It's about visibility, accuracy and speed and that's the value that we can bring with Skillvue.

Companies to excel today need to know:
↳ What skills they have in house (𝘪𝘯 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭-𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦)
↳ How fast people could learn new skills (𝘵𝘩𝘦 ""𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘨𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘺"")
↳ What skills they'll need (𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘱𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘮𝘢𝘳𝘬𝘦𝘵)
↳ How to close the gap (𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘪𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯)

Meanwhile, Deloitte US announced a company-wide reset of its job titles, modernizing their talent architecture to provide a more tailored experience reflective of their professionals' broad range of skills and the work they do.

The labor market isn't changing. It has already changed.
And while we're redesigning orga charts, AI is already rewriting the rules of the game.

Soprattutto sui profili più junior, ciò che fa davvero la differenza è la capacità di osservare potenziale, competenze soft e motivazione. Un esempio concreto che abbiamo vissuto in Skillvue è quello di Mattia.

Un anno fa stavamo costruendo il team Sales e avevamo aperto due posizioni: BDR e Senior Account Executive. Mattia si è candidato per la prima, pur non avendo esperienza pregressa in Sales.
Quello che ha dimostrato durante l’assessment Skillvue, era un forte interesse per la nostra realtà, una grande motivazione e che possedesse alcune competenze allineate ad un ruolo Sales.
Durante il colloquio, il suo potenziale è apparso così evidente che abbiamo capito potesse portare ancora più valore in un ruolo da Account Executive.

È entrato a marzo '25.
E da lì in poi è stato un lavoro a 4 mani, noi formazione e affiancamento, lui impegno, curiosità e attitudine.
E ora che siamo in chiusura di anno ha fatto 2x sull'obiettivo che gli era stato assegnato.

Non condivido questa storia per celebrare Mattia (anche se oggi è il suo compleanno e se lo merita), ma perché rappresenta in modo semplice e concreto l’importanza di guardare oltre il CV e valutare competenze, potenziale e motivazione.

In Skillvue lo diciamo spesso: lo skill-based hiring non è uno slogan, è un approccio. E quando lo applichi in modo sistematico e oggettivo all'interno dei processi di talent acquisition, i risultati arrivano.","Gianmarco Savi","activity","urn:li:share:7404928182740795392","2025-11-22","Valid 7404928184380805120","ACoAAB0uVb0BqYKRBpv1Ni76HnbllFMox4Dt03E","ACwAAB0u","ACwAAB0uVb0BmXZ5Etgtsrdse6IoDonaVKWKiY4","ACwAAB0u","✅ Record Found","false",,false

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7400455968389758977","Yes","Something fundamental is shifting in software architecture. And most people are missing it.

For decades, we've built systems in three layers. Data stores and retrieves. Logic processes and orchestrates. Presentation displays and captures input. Clean boundaries. Clear responsibilities. 

That model is breaking down — not because it was wrong, but because every layer is gaining intelligence.

The data layer is becoming conversational—vector embeddings, semantic search, natural language queries. Your database no longer executes queries. It helps you understand what you mean.

The orchestration layer is embracing human logic. AI agents that reason, handle ambiguity, and make judgments: business logic that isn't just coded rules, but adaptive decision-making.

And the presentation layer — where we focus at Mindset AI — has gained an entirely new responsibility.

It's no longer enough to render interfaces and capture input. The presentation layer must now determine what the user is actually trying to accomplish and help them do so in the most elegant and optimal way.

This is a profound shift. 

The interface becomes an interpreter of intent, not just a display of options. A guide to optimal paths, not just a menu of choices. A contextual orchestrator that serves the right experience — conversation, widget, visual, or hybrid — based on what the moment requires.

The recent MCP Apps announcement from Anthropic and OpenAI formalises part of this shift: rich, interactive UI served contextually within conversational AI. 

Conversation as the orchestration layer. Widgets rendered when visual interaction serves the user better than text.

But here's what many are missing:

This isn't about being inside ChatGPT or Claude. It's about who owns the intelligent presentation layer across every surface where your customers interact with you.

Your website. Your app. WhatsApp. Slack. Teams. And yes, the AI platforms too.

The companies that thrive in this new architecture won't be the ones who bolted a chatbot onto their existing UI. They'll be the ones who rebuilt their presentation layer with this new responsibility at its core: Understand intent. Guide optimally. Serve the right experience. Everywhere.

That's the future we're building at Mindset AI.","Barrie Hadfield","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7400455965361201152","2025-11-22","Valid 7400455965361201152","ACoAAAIKIDMBVtJejrX1rXpxsdWa2VjuDOjAXv4","ACwAAAIK","ACwAAAIKIDMB3DMA_wueR7Jb5L0TxrS0Ima2sAQ","ACwAAAIK","✅ Record Found","false",,false

Napędzana przez bardzo konkretne zmiany konsumenckie: potrzeba prostoty, przewidywalności i produktów, które „pojawiają się wtedy, kiedy są potrzebne” — bez konieczności podejmowania kolejnych decyzji.

W 2024 roku globalny rynek subscription e-commerce osiągnął 326,4 mld USD. Do 2029 roku wzrośnie do 3,48 bln USD.

W ostatnich tygodniach analizowałam, skąd bierze się ten wzrost, jakie modele faktycznie działają i dlaczego właśnie teraz subskrypcje produktów fizycznych rosną szybciej niż cały #ecommerce.

Efekt tej pracy znajdziesz w najnowszej analizie na enjoygrowth.pro — link zostawiam w komentarzu 🔗

Co znajdziesz w środku?
– najważniejsze zmiany konsumenckie, które przyspieszają rozwój subskrypcji,
– 10 modeli subskrypcyjnych z przykładami marek (w tym produktów fizycznych),
– aktualne dane rynkowe i prognozy,
– oraz to, co z tego strategicznie wynika dla e-commerce.

Dzisiejszy materiał otwiera cykl, nad którym pracujemy wspólnie z Juo #WspółpracaReklamowa. Juo to platforma technologiczna do subskrypcji w e-commerce (szczególnie produktów fizycznych). Umożliwia markom budowanie i skalowanie modeli przewidywalnych przychodów dzięki infrastrukturze, która upraszcza wdrożenie i zarządzanie subskrypcjami — bez zbędnej złożoności i nadmiaru integracji.

We celebrated every new purchase. And a fee too. Today, such volume would only put a slight smile on our faces, as we're now processing thousands of transactions daily without breaking a sweat.

But the goal isn’t thousands a day. It’s thousands per hour, or even per minute.

People ask if I’m worried about handling that scale. I’m not, not even on days like today. As the CTO, and simply as one of the engineers working in a team. Because we've already proven that the team we've built will handle every challenge thrown at them. At us.

This is exactly where our recently announced €4M seed round led by Market One Capital and Peak, with participation from BADideas.fund, SMOK Ventures, FJ Labs, and Lakestar, comes into play. It provides the fuel to deliver on an ambitious roadmap designed to handle both product and business growth.

So, what exactly are we building?

We're building a platform that lets devs and operators create any custom mission-critical subscription application on top of it. The platform is built on three core principles:

- Control: Developers need control over the entire subscription lifecycle.
- Flexibility: Our platform handles the core logic and guardrails, but never throws obstacles in your path.
- Future-proofing: We are supporting all interfaces, including agentic ones.

We learned through our clients that adoption at this level requires aligning perfectly with business needs. Personally, my observation is that ecommerce developers have never been taken care of properly, the way SaaS developers are. I want to change this.

Our first big step on this roadmap is shipping Blocks, a completely new way to build subscriber interfaces that leverages AI-supported dev environments. Feel free to DM me if you’d like to join our dev team or get access to the Private Beta as a client.

As you already know, Juo has recently secured €4M in funding in a seed round led by top European investors — Market One Capital and Peak. Today, I want to share why we raised this round and what product vision the money from this round will help us pursue.

Some products and industries feel natural for subscriptions. But our ambition is to make it also natural for those brands who are just discovering the potential of recurring. Subscriptions of physical, or — as we call them, non-digital — products are evolving beyond the simple ""subscribe and save"". Now, when acquiring a customer often requires attention to many touchpoints (including many new ones, like AI chats), being able to transition one-time purchases into relationships becomes appealing and more important than ever before.

Good news — the possibilities for subscription programs are endless.

And we're here to make sure that the technology enabling them is never the limitation.

Our plan isn't just about catching up with the future. We want to actively shape it. We're all about empowering a brand-new P&L, predictable revenue, higher LTV, and products loved by subscribers that come back on their own. The market doesn't know this is possible yet — but we'll show them. We're in the business of going from products to programs.

And the recent financing and the new network's insights will support Juo in this mission.

With our core platform adapting to every business case, dev tooling to build any custom mission-critical subscription application, and agentic commerce-ready modules, we're giving a new tech superpower to any brand who takes customers and products long-term seriously.

And you know what? We'll give access to it and build it together with a community of our clients and partners, so that the platform is not ours — it’s yours.

So! If you're an operator, an agency or a dev looking for the access to next-gen subscription layer to shape it to your needs — DM me.

Today Juo is announcing our €4M seed round led by Market One Capital and Peak, with participation from BADideas.fund, SMOK Ventures, FJ Labs, and Lakestar. Also, Mark Ransford, Marek Gut, Maciej Zawadzinski, and Louis Pfitzner are officially joining our investor team.

This is an important milestone in our journey to build the default backbone for non-digital subscriptions. At Juo, we believe every great business with an excellent product deserves the superpower to turn a one-time purchase into a relationship. We're not about faster checkouts — we're in the business of going from products to programs, from transactions to relationships.

Although the fundraising itself happened quickly and closed with oversubscription, the process of getting there took a while and consisted of a series of product experiments. Along the way, we solved several pseudo-problems, but thanks to that, we found the trail of several real ones, and when we solved those, everything took off.

Since then, we've already gained solid momentum in several EU markets, especially the Netherlands — one of the most advanced ecom ecosystems in Europe. We learned a tremendous amount in the process, thanks to the belief and close collaboration of fantastic early clients such as Your KAYA, MOG, Mother's Earth, Polarwise, and Guud.

I'm incredibly proud of my team that throughout this entire time, no one doubted or gave up on the path to finding true product-market fit. It's wonderful to be part of a tribe that doesn't accept compromises — not only when it comes to product quality, but also company values and team principles. That's a trait of the best.

And the new investor lineup? Speaks for itself. I'm thrilled that our team is getting support from absolutely top-tier funds, bringing ambition and confidence to the table. And since at Juo we have a habit of working closely with the investors, we'll give the same back. As an entrepreneur-physicist, I call it a very special type of reciprocal force relationship.

In the upcoming months, with the new funding, we'll focus on developing our dev platform for building any subscription offering while separating work contexts for business operators and developers, and the new toolkit ready for the arrival of the agentic commerce era. If you want to join our mission in building the subscription layer that teams can shape into any desired subscription application, reach out to us — we're hiring.

We're thankful to everyone who believed in our vision: Jacek, Thijs, David, Ben, Raimonds, 🌈 Borys, Tomasz, Jose, Arne H., Navid, all of our early investors (special bows to Wojciech and Łukasz), and all the people who supported the fundraising process during and after it: Barbara, Karolina, Arta, Mārtiņš, Maryla, Jakub, Ģirts, Suhas, Jordi, Marcin, Łukasz, and many others.

After our 5m EUR funding round, Jan Thomas from Startup Insider took the chance to grill me on a few topics:
- Why will UMH bring manufacturers into the AI age?
- What did you learn in a ""1.5 years due diligence""? 
- Why ist the next funding round NOT our next goal?
- What was it like raising funding as an ex-investor? 
- What was the emotional journey of changing jobs?

Whether you're building AI or just helping your team make better decisions. That foundation eats 90% of the project. Most teams never get past it.

We spent years as system integrators and consultants. Crawling under conveyors, wiring sensors, building dashboards. Same story everywhere: machine data trapped in silos. Projects shelved before they start because the data work alone takes months.

UMH is the foundation we wished existed. Open-source. Community-centric and product-first. We're not building data infrastructure for its own sake. We're cutting the time it takes to actually improve production. In Europe and everywhere else.

Where we are today: thousands of users, dozens of manufacturers, sites across Europe & the world. HiPP, Böllhoff, Edeka and many more: Edeka for over three years.

What's next: a better experience for OT, IT, and AI agents alike. Wider connectivity. A stronger open-source core. Strategic partnerships to reach more factories worldwide. All to do one thing: cut the time from problem to solution.

€5M to make this the standard. Led by KOMPAS VC, joined by seed + speed Ventures, Sustainable Future Ventures, and Archimedes New Ventures and Backed by people who've done this: Jan Oberhauser from n8n, Jeff Hammerbacher from Cloudera. And many more great founders and operators.

None of this could have happened without our incredible team. Thank you! We're hiring. Link in the comments.

Short answer: yes and no

I attended WEF in Davos for the first time this year without a conference pass.
Mostly side events. A lot of walking. A lot of coke zero.

Finding the right people is not easy. Many events attract broad audiences. Topics are big. Target groups are not always sharp.

If you go in expecting a classic conference with structured lead generation, you’ll be disappointed.

But.

There is almost no other place with this density of senior decision-makers.
CEOs, board members, investors all within a few streets.

The probability of randomly bumping into someone genuinely interesting is unusually high.

My most important learning: Nowhere is the importance of the network more apparent than in Davos. 

Your calendar matters less than who introduces you to whom.

Would I do it again? Probably yes.
Would I do it differently? Also yes.

Thank you very much for all the great conversations I had.

🪨 We hired some truly exceptional talent
🪨 We entered the German and Austrian markets
🪨 We closed our seed round and gained strong believers in our journey with VENPACE, SixThirty Ventures, SICTIC, COREangels, Gateway Ventures and NCA
🪨 We published our first two hypt reports in collaboration with University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland FHNW and Prof Dr Marc K Peter

Our CEO Philippe Beucher and CSO Viorel Opait are learning. 

That’s the wonder of being a Start-up. 

Living in depth. More than conversations and meeting leads. 

They learned new perspectives:

✨how to present RSight® clearly to a new market

✨how much you learn by watching how others show up

✨how different markets talk about the same hiring pain in very different ways

RSight® is built for a global audience.
Understanding culture, expectations, and local hiring realities isn’t optional. It’s how you stay relevant.

The better we listen, the better we execute.

A role opens.
A request comes in.
Recruitment starts.

But today, that model is breaking.

When companies shift from reactive hiring to orchestration, everything changes.
Hiring becomes predictable and not urgent because recruiters move from execution to strategy:

• Data replaces guesswork
• Time is spent on decisions, not repetition

Agentic AI enables this shift by handling the operational load while teams focus on planning, alignment, and outcomes.

The future of hiring is not faster reactions.
It is a better preparation.
And that is where competitive advantage begins.

But to become bulletproof in a warehouse-native world, we consistently see within our Astrato Analytics, customer migrating over from legacy BI base, that a new skill stack starts to compound.

Because once the centre of gravity shifts from BI-engine logic to upstream models, what matters changes.

And yes - that shift exposes the limits of app-bound, in-memory architectures.

✅ 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 - beyond SELECT / GROUP BY. Window functions, CTEs, query plans, performance tuning. SQL becomes your primary modeling language - no longer constrained by an app-bound in-memory engine. You’re building composable, extensible data logic that serves multiple tools and AI workloads - not just a single BI surface.

✅ 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹-𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 - layered transformations (staging → intermediate → marts). Bronze/Silver/Gold architectures resemble 3-tier QVD patterns - but are version-controlled, testable, and designed for cross-tool reuse rather than reload performance inside one engine.

✅ 𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹 & 𝗚𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀 - branching, pull requests, code reviews. Analytics adopts real production lifecycles instead of app-level scripting cycles.

✅ 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗼𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 - model-level tests, validating assumptions, monitoring freshness and drift. Data logic becomes verifiable - not just visually validated in a dashboard.

✅ 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁 & 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 - understanding how query design impacts compute and spend. Performance is no longer just about making charts fast - it’s about building financially scalable data platforms.

✅ 𝗦𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰/𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 - defining metrics once and serving BI, notebooks, APIs, and AI workloads consistently. Metrics become shared assets - not engine-specific expressions.

The shift is from BI developer → analytics engineer.

Less engine-specific wizardry.
More model architecture.

And the same thing keeps coming up:

Analytics is quietly becoming the #1 reason customers stick with your product. 🔥

Not your features. Not your UI. Not your integrations. Your analytics.

This is especially true for data companies - where data IS the product. Your users expect to see, explore, and act on their data inside YOUR app. Not a separate tool. Not a spreadsheet export.

And the product that nails this creates a switching cost that's almost impossible to replicate. 💡

But here's the thing - most data companies try to build this from scratch.

Analytics is deceptively hard. 😅

Multi-tenancy. Permissioning. Performance at scale. White-labelling. Live data. Exports. Embeddability.

""3 engineers, one quarter"" turns into a permanent team and 2 years of work.

The irony? You're a data company - but your engineers are building chart rendering instead of the actual data product. 🤦

Meanwhile your competitor embedded analytics in weeks and shipped 3 new core features. 🚀

The smartest teams I'm seeing in 2026 treat embedded analytics like auth or payments:

👉 You don't build Stripe.
👉 You don't build Auth0.

So why are you building Tableau? 🤔

For years the playbook was clear:
database ➡️ warehouse ➡️ analytics tool

Today many teams ship products much earlier, and their operational database becomes part of the user experience. Reporting isn’t just internal anymore - it’s customer-facing and embedded into the app itself. 📊 💲 

That’s where Supabase fits beautifully - a production-ready backend built on PostgreSQL that teams can start with and grow on.

Astrato already works with Snowflake, BigQuery and Databricks when companies run a full data platform. Supabase extends this to product teams who want to add customer-facing analytics directly on top of their application database.  

The challenge is that teams often end up (vibe)coding dashboards themselves using React and charting libraries - and analytics quietly becomes a second product to maintain.

A few years into building Astrato Analytics - and after supporting a growing number of organisations, from SMB to large enterprises, moving from Qlik to Astrato on Snowflake/ Google BigQuery / Databricks- one pattern keeps repeating:

Across tech stacks, these are the most transferable skills I consistently see:

✅ 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 - Understanding facts vs dimensions, grain, star vs snowflake schemas, and performance tradeoffs maps directly to warehouse modeling and upstream transformations

✅ 𝗞𝗣𝗜 & 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 - Turning business questions into trusted definitions - from simple sums and counts to period growth %, running totals, moving averages, ranks, and percentiles - and formalising calculation logic in a governed way

✅ 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗲𝘁 - Reconciling numbers, tracing discrepancies, and pressure-testing aggregations and calculations - fully portable across stacks

✅ 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 - Converting messy requirements into structured logic, turning stakeholder intent into reusable data definitions, and producing analytics that are actually consumable and interactive

The tooling changes. The warehouse changes. The interfaces change.
But the core craft - modeling, metrics, validation, and business thinking - compounds.

If you’re strong in those, you’re already closer to modern analytics engineering than you think.","Martin Mahler 📊 🍓","activity","urn:li:share:7425536125621919744","2025-11-22","Valid 7425536127060807681","ACoAAAnoy2wBliAdaOVJFhIi8YOSHkIYxt7lKlI","ACwAAAno","ACwAAAnoy2wBvTlIXutM5cED8d9omtPHzTn3k28","ACwAAAno","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Historically framed as an evolution of BI, it mines and visualizes human-led processes like Order-to-Cash or Payments to surface inefficiencies and revenue leakages.

But by 2028, its real importance will be in Agentic AI.
Not just to observe what agents do, but to understand how they arrived there: their reasoning paths, decision branches, failure points, and stalls.

Process Mining will become the debugger of the agentic enterprise.

However, debugging alone is not enough. The enterprise will still need a semantic, decision, and action layer where humans and agents agree on meaning, intent, and outcomes. That’s where modern BI and data-apps platforms evolve.

Process logs will become just another domain of data to reason over, optimize, and operationalize.

Beyond watching agents, we will start Lean-optimizing their decision flows, and eventually agents will review and heal their own processes.

I’ve followed mpmX by MEHRWERK for many years. From a Qlik add-on to a platform-agnostic solution and now integrated with Camunda, their trajectory shows how serious the plumbing has to be for this future to work.

The real value isn’t in hype.

When I was studying Aeronautical Engineering (MSc), I approached my professor for advice. My studies had been purely theoretical (which I loved), but to work in the industry I felt I needed credibility and experience in practice.

I explored doing/paying for a programme to do the UK CAA Part-66 Category A (CAT A) Aircraft Maintenance Licence (steps towards becoming an aircraft technician). I sought my professor's confirmation that it was worth doing and if it would help me in my career as an engineer.

""If you want to become a technician, go do it,"" he said.

I didn't. I pinpointed him about my thesis: that it would differentiate me as a candidate in my career, and be nice credentials alongside my MSc.

He didn't answer my question. Instead, he said I should study what I like, work where I like, and do that.
""If you want to study aeronautical engineering, but then want to work with polar bears, you should go to the North Pole and become a researcher.""

It was frustrating as this didn't help at all. But a few years later I realized this encounter was powerful.

I was indoctrinated to believe career paths are fixed, that they need to be built like Lego stones towards a masterplan. Life isn't fixed like that. You can change the rules at any time, and with hard work, pursue whatever you like, whenever you like.

I didn't go to the North Pole, but after uni I moved away from aeronautical engineering and never looked back. I eventually became an entrepreneur in data analytics, doing what I love and enjoy.

The acquisition wasn’t glamorous, but it solved their biggest gap in the analytics value chain: enterprise-grade static reporting.

It became a pillar for QlikView/Qlik Sense and the #1 use case for Vizlib's extensions to support.

For years BI vendors tried to push users away from static reports - partly vision, partly fear of cannibalising seat licences. But static reporting never died.

Because static reporting isn’t “legacy.” It’s a high-leverage distribution layer of analytics. 📡

Most data use cases are simple:
What are my numbers? Up or down?
The deeper “why” comes later - and for a smaller group of users.

Static reporting remains critical as it enables:
📑fixed, auditable views
🧭consistent leadership narratives
📤portable insights across teams

The Levin Sources pre-conference hike was the perfect start. Put mining people on a trail with no agenda and the conversations just happen. Thank you, Estelle Levin-Nally and Dr. Rebecca Lee Pein - Skeleton Gorge hike next year? 😄

The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) Breakfast stood out as well. People from very different parts of the industry, all looking at the same standard from completely different angles. That’s how standards should be tested - through real discussion, not polite alignment.

 → What proof do buyers actually need? 
 → Who carries the risk when something goes wrong? 
 → How do responsibilities split between operators, investors, and purchasers?

These aren’t compliance questions, they’re partnership questions.

This is my first time attending Investing in African Mining Indaba, and I’m very interested in the side events where these questions are discussed openly.

Over the past 3 years, number of CDP disclosing companies has declined, yet the number of A-Listers has grown significantly:

📉 Companies disclosing: 23,200 → 22,100 (−5%)
📈 A-List companies: 396 → 877 (+122%)

Meaning, A-List rate doubled from 1.7% → 4.4% in two years.

The graph below makes it even more visible:
- Both metrics are indexed to 100 at the 2023 baseline.
- If both moved together, the lines would track roughly in parallel.
- Instead, they diverge by 127 points in opposite directions.

So what’s up?

Two explanations (pick yours):

1) Rapid improvement:
The companies still disclosing are genuinely getting better. = Optimistic one

2) Selection + scoring dynamics
Weaker companies opted out, and CDP may have become more generous with giving A’s. Especially because A-List status is basically the only valuable thing companies get out of it.

Could be nice to go for the first one. But judging by the broader score decline (see my earlier posts), the more realistic answer is: a small group improved, many dropped out, and the bar for A-list has moved.

You know me, I’m always cynical. What’s your view here?

And if you’re wondering why when A’s are being handed out you still got a B (or C!), check out free beSirius  CDP scoring analysis tool. Clear heatmaps, question by question analysis, and a tailored improvement roadmap for the next year. First users are ecstatic. 🤩

At Future Minerals Forum in Riyadh this week, this came up in almost every conversation I had. Teams are dealing with tight budgets and need to show value, but exhaustive due diligence on every supplier is too expensive and too slow to sustain.

For years, due diligence expanded in one direction: more risks, more requirements, more controls, more suppliers. That improved coverage but didn't really improve control.

What's shifting now is how companies allocate attention:
🔸 Go deep on suppliers where risks are material
🔸 Maintain lighter oversight across the rest
🔸 Stop spreading resources so thin that nothing gets proper attention

This approach wasn't feasible before because narrowing scope meant blind spots. What makes it work now is AI infrastructure that reuses existing disclosures, structures evidence, and flags gaps continuously. Teams can focus without missing critical issues.

The graph shows what this looks like compared to other approaches

In our recent newsletter Anastasia Kuskova covers this shift in more detail.

⚠️ What’s changing now is how companies allocate attention. Thanks to tighter budgets, regulatory uncertainty, critical supply risks, and the accumulated craziness of 2025.

So what does it mean?

In practice, companies can operate across four due diligence postures:

🔷 Baseline orientation
Broad visibility, limited follow-up.

🔷 Exhaustive
Deep scrutiny applied widely: expensive and heavy.

🔷 Compliance
Narrow focus on what is strictly required.

🔷 Strategic
Targeted depth on a limited number of material risks.

ℹ️ None of these is inherently right or wrong. Each reflects maturity, supply-chain complexity, and strategic intent.

For a long time, strategic due diligence wasn’t really feasible. Without broad analysis, narrowing scope meant risking blind spots. So companies either went exhaustive, or stayed shallow.

‼️ The shift we see in 2026: strategic due diligence becomes the ONLY commercially viable option for many companies. Because teams need to show value and demonstrate the business case. You can’t deliver it if you are spreading too thin.

It’s a shift toward narrowing scope and increasing depth where it actually changes outcomes:

• fewer demands per supplier
• less repeated disclosures
• clearer separation between monitoring and intervention
• deeper engagement with suppliers on genuinely material risks

🤖This shift would not be possible without AI. It’s a critical infrastructure that makes judgment possible at scale. By reusing existing disclosures, structuring evidence, and continuously highlighting real gaps, AI makes it possible to focus attention without blind spots.

Without this layer, strategic due diligence stays theoretical. With it, it becomes operational.

We’re publishing a deeper analysis on this evolution, including implications for traceability, supplier engagement, and due-diligence design.

The focus was very much on the practical side of due diligence, circularity and the Battery Passport – and what this means for day-to-day work across the value chain.

A lot of conversations came back to the GBA Framework: 26 modules and ~1,000 criteria that are quickly becoming a key reference for responsible sourcing. Powerful, but hard to manage manually when evidence is scattered and suppliers sit deep in the supply chain.

The new Benchmarking Framework introduces A / AA / AAA grading and is now being tested to check EU Batteries Regulation compliance, support the Battery Passport and trial third-party assurance.

At beSirius, we’ve been preparing for this shift for a while. Our due diligence module already maps the Beta Release of the Battery Benchmarks, organises supplier evidence, identifies gaps and shows performance along the grading scale—so companies can start working with it today and keep reusing the same structured data as benchmarking and verification evolve.

📍Mixed versions of supplier data that need reconciliation

📍Smelter information that requires manual verification

📍Inputs spread across procurement, sustainability and legal, slowing alignment

The Scoreboard Just Changed...

If you are feeling the weight of ""Climate Fatigue"" as we go into 2026, look at the scoreboard. We just chalked up a massive W in the Asia bracket. 🌏🏆

Fresh data released this week confirms that India has officially crossed 51% installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources.

Why does this matter? Because the goal post was set for 2030. They didn’t just meet the target; they smashed it 5 years early. 🚀⏩

This isn't a ""pledge."" This isn't a ""hope."" This is steel, silicon, and grid infrastructure already in the ground. While some narratives often paint developing nations as the ""problem,"" India is proving they are speedboats of the transition.

The Takeaway: Systems change happens slowly, and then all at once. When we start counting the Gigawatts, the momentum is undeniable.

Let’s keep going. ⚡

2025 was a wild year in #sustainability reporting and action. 

Game-changing comprehensive frameworks were published, only to be challenged and postponed.

We'd seen huge leaps forward in mandatory and voluntary #energy and #carbon strategies, at the same time as the rule book being torn up and tossed into the plastic-filled sea.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ""Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors"" rule was adopted in March 2024 but quickly faced multiple lawsuits and the SEC withdrew its legal defence in March 2025.

So the SEC doesn't feature in our #webinar on where we are now and where we're going in 2026 and beyond...

But plenty of other governments and bodies are ploughing through, knowing that climate breakdown isn't going away.

And you know what? Even if we think 'stuff the environment', we'll want to manage our corporate climate risks, just like any other risks to our business.

From the EU and UK to California and Australia, new frameworks are redefining what’s required and what’s expected.

Join 51toCarbonZero's Will Richardson (FIEMA) and me this Wednesday (14th) as we break down:

👉 The status of #CSRD, CBAM, ASRS, UK SRS and other global disclosure frameworks

👉 What the new Science Based Targets initiative Net Zero Standard could mean for corporations around the globe

👉 How to move forward with clarity, even when the rules are still shifting

Viel Geschichte. Viel Tradition. Viel Gewachsenes.

Genau dort, im Historischen Börsensaal der Handelskammer Hamburg, fand letzte Woche die 13. Hamburger bAV-Tagung vom Institut für betriebliche Altersversorgung und Steuern der Universität Hamburg statt.
Und genau dieses Ambiente stand im Kontrast zu einem Teil der Inhalte, die dort diskutiert wurden.

Denn viele der rund 400 Teilnehmenden kamen nicht nur, um sich über aktuelle Entwicklungen zu informieren, sondern auch, um tiefer in eine zentrale Frage einzutauchen:
Wie lässt sich die betriebliche Altersvorsorge moderner aufstellen und mit digitalen Mitteln besser machen.

Das war nicht das einzige Thema der Tagung.
Aber es war eines, das sich in mehreren Vorträgen und vor allem in vielen Gesprächen wiedergefunden hat.
Es ging um Strukturen, Prozesse und die Frage, wie historisch gewachsene Systeme im Unternehmensalltag handhabbar bleiben.

In diesem Kontext sind mir besonders die Gespräche mit Martin de Vries, Michael Ries, Jens Gustenhoven und Dirk Schätzke im Gedächtnis geblieben.
Vielen Dank für den Austausch!

Weil Modernisierung und Digitalisierung auf der Tagung ein zentrales Thema waren, gab es auch in den Pausen immer wieder Interesse an unserem Ausstellerstand.
Das hat gut gezeigt, wie groß der Bedarf an praktikablen Lösungen in der bAV inzwischen ist.

Für uns war die Hamburger bAV-Tagung eine sehr gelungene Fachtagung in besonderem Rahmen.

Seit 2025 setzt Cansativa Group auf Penzilla.
Was früher administrativer Aufwand für HR war, läuft heute automatisch. Denn Penzilla übernimmt die gesamte bAV-Verwaltung und reduziert den administrativen Aufwand um bis zu 100%.

Und das Ergebnis zeigt sich deutlich: Die bAV wird von den Mitarbeitenden aktiv genutzt und als echter Benefit wahrgenommen. Ein klarer Zugewinn für beide Seiten.

Denn da standen wieder einmal unsere Creative Days an. Traditionell kommt dazu das ganze Team nach München – egal ob Office-Crew oder Remote. Und dieses Mal mussten wir wirklich zusammenrücken.

Der Grund für das Gedränge? Ein unglaublich erfolgreiches 2025! 🚀

Unser Team ist gewachsen, und zwar um 66%! Und das ist lange nicht der einzige Meilenstein, auf den wir während unserer Creative Days stolz zurückgeblickt haben:

👉 Wir haben unsere Seed-Finanzierungsrunde erfolgreich abgeschlossen.
👉 Wir standen im Finale des HR Startup Awards.
👉 Wir haben eine Vielzahl neuer Penzilla-Nutzer hinzugewonnen, die uns mit einem hervorragenden NPS von 82 begeistert weiterempfehlen.
👉 Wir konnten unsere Bekanntheit deutlich steigern.
👉 Und wir haben unser Produkt mit der DATEV-Schnittstelle für einen automatischen Lohndatenexport in die Payroll entscheidend weiterentwickelt.

Nach so vielen Erfolgen gab es nur noch eines zu tun: Das Ganze auf der Penzilla-Weihnachtsfeier bei gutem Essen und anschließender Party gebührend zu feiern! 🥳

Tag 2 der Creative Days gehört traditionell dem Teambuilding.
Diesmal ging es bei einer Stadtrallye in vier gemischten Teams quer durch die Münchner Innenstadt. Echter Nervenkitzel schon am frühen Morgen, denn natürlich wollte jede Gruppe beim gemeinsamen Rätsellösen die beste sein. 
Den Abschluss machte – fast schon rituell – unser Eisstockschießen, bei dem die vier Gruppen aus der Stadtrallye die Chance auf eine Revanche bekamen.

Wir gehen mit einem absoluten Hochgefühl in die Weihnachtsfeiertage. Die Erfolge geben uns enormen Rückenwind, und der Blick auf die Roadmap hat uns jetzt schon wieder richtig angezündet. Wir nutzen die Pause kurz zum Durchatmen – aber eigentlich kribbelt es uns jetzt schon in den Fingern, 2026 direkt wieder Vollgas zu geben. 💪

Eines, bei dem man erst beim Zurückblicken realisiert, wie viele Meilensteine da eigentlich zusammengekommen sind.

Wir haben dieses Jahr mit Rückenwind begonnen, dank einer erfolgreich abgeschlossenen Seed-Finanzierungsrunde getragen von unseren starken Partnern Acadian Ventures, Delin Ventures, Robin Capital, WENVEST Capital, Motive Ventures und unseren Angels, die an unsere Vision glauben und sie möglich machen. 🙌

Wir sind gewachsen. Richtig gewachsen.
Um 66 Prozent mehr Team, mehr Ideen, mehr Drive. So viel, dass unser Office in der Rottmannstraße irgendwann nicht mehr gereicht hat und wir im März ein neues Kapitel in der Sandstraße aufgeschlagen haben. 🏢

Wir haben unser Produkt konsequent weitergebaut; mit einem Feature, auf das wir besonders stolz sind: Der Payroll-Integration über DATEV. Automatisierte bAV-Daten direkt in die Lohnbuchhaltung. Später im Jahr kam sogar noch SAP dazu. 🚀

Und wir haben gesehen, dass sich all das auszahlt: Immer mehr namhafte Unternehmen setzen auf Penzilla und empfehlen uns mit einem Net Promoter Score von 82 begeistert weiter.  💜

Ein echtes Highlight war auch unser Auftritt als Finalist beim HR Startup Award auf dem Personalmanagementkongress (PMK) in Berlin. So vielen HR-Entscheiderinnen und -Entscheidern unser Produkt zu pitchen, war etwas ganz Besonderes. 🏆

Dazu kamen Messen, Events, Medienauftritte und viele Gespräche, die gezeigt haben: Die Automatisierung der bAV-Verwaltung und die Entlastung von HR-Teams ist gerade in diesen Zeiten, wo Unternehmen verstärkt auf Effektivität und Produktivitätssteigerung setzen, das Thema der Stunde. Und wir sind mittendrin.

2026 darf sich warm anziehen – die Messlatte liegt hoch.
Aber heute sagen wir erst einmal: Danke, 2025. 💜

Maschinenbauer wie Coperion oder Hymmen GmbH Maschinen- und Anlagenbau haben dieses Jahr bewiesen, dass Ersatzteilplanung kein Bauchgefühl bleiben muss: 
🔩 Automatisierte Planung über zehntausende Teile.
🔩 Zweistellig höhere Verfügbarkeit. 
🔩 Verhinderte Lost Orders, die den Software-Invest mehrfach amortisieren.

Besonders spannend für mich:
Fast jeder Kunde startet skeptisch - vor allem beim Thema Daten. Und fast jeder ist nach kurzer Zeit überzeugt. Nicht, weil wir gut erklären. Sondern weil die Zahlen sprechen.

Wenn du Serviceleiter bist und merkst, dass Excel, ERP-Logik und Firefighting euch ausbremsen, dann ist jetzt ein guter Zeitpunkt für ein Gespräch. Schreib mir direkt oder buche einen Termin.

Unsere Art, darüber nachzudenken, schon.
In fast jedem Gespräch höre ich aktuell denselben Satz:
„Wir würden ja gerne schneller digitalisieren - aber Data Security …“

Und genau hier liegt der Denkfehler.

Datensicherheit ist kein Stoppschild.

Sie ist der Rahmen, innerhalb dessen Fortschritt möglich wird.
Was den deutschen Maschinenbau heute wirklich bremst, sind nicht zu hohe Sicherheitsanforderungen –
sondern fehlende Struktur, fehlende Klarheit
und die Angst, Verantwortung für neue Wege zu übernehmen.

Die Unternehmen, die jetzt vorankommen, tun etwas sehr Konkretes:
Sie trennen Datenhoheit von Datennutzung.
Sie setzen auf Transparenz statt Black Boxes.
Und sie denken Security als Enabler, nicht als Verhinderer.

Ich habe das in der neuen REBUILD MASCHINENBAU-Edition aufgeschrieben –
nicht als Klage, sondern als klare Anleitung,
was wir jetzt tun müssen, um Digitalisierung mit Vertrauen umzusetzen.

👉 Warum Data Security uns nicht lähmen darf –
 sondern der Schlüssel für Tempo, Service-Exzellenz und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit ist.

Wir reden seit Jahren über Effizienz, Digitalisierung, KI - aber am Ende steht und fällt alles mit den Menschen im Service. Ohne sie gibt’s keine Verfügbarkeit, keine Kundenzufriedenheit, keinen Umsatz. Punkt.

Genau deshalb freue ich mich unglaublich, dass Katja Bültermann beim Service Pioneers Summit 2026 die Bühne bekommt, die sie verdient.
Ihr Blick auf das „Silver Tsunami“-Thema ist nicht nur notwendig, er trifft ins Herz der Realität vieler Maschinenbauer.

Was ich besonders stark finde:
Sie zeigt nicht nur das Problem, sondern konkrete Wege, wie Service wieder attraktiv wird, für junge Talente, für Quereinsteiger, für Menschen, die Sinn und Impact suchen.
Und das passt perfekt zur Mission unseres Summits: Service neu denken: menschlich, digital, zukunftssicher.

Wenn du wissen willst,
wie moderne Ersatzteilprozesse funktionieren,
wie KI Service-Teams entlastet statt ersetzt,
und wie du heute die Talente für morgen gewinnst,

dann solltest du am 26. Februar 2026 in Metzingen dabei sein.

Durante la tavola rotonda “Ecosistemi digitali e governance del turismo” Abbiamo condiviso una visione comune: il viaggio è sempre più un percorso fatto di micro-decisioni, pagamenti, interazioni digitali e strumenti di AI, che devono essere fluidi, sicuri e orientati all’esperienza del viaggiatore. 
A parer mio, il focus sulla prevenzione delle frodi “invisibile” è rilevante: verificare in modo intelligente identità e contatti già in fase di prenotazione significa proteggere l’ecosistema senza creare frizioni, contrastando fenomeni come fake reservations e sabotage booking. 

In un contesto in cui l’AI e gli agenti digitali stanno diventando parte integrante del customer journey, la sfida sarà sempre più quella di distinguere tra interazioni legittime e comportamenti fraudolenti, mantenendo un’esperienza semplice e affidabile. 

Grazie a Silvia Elia per la moderazione e a Elisa Boggiani, Giovanni Benassi e Pietro Candela per il confronto aperto e stimolante. Un ringraziamento speciale a BIT Milano per aver creato uno spazio di dialogo concreto su temi così strategici per il sistema travel italiano.
Confronti come questo sono fondamentali per costruire, insieme, un turismo più innovativo, sicuro e sostenibile.

In modo efficace, viene raccontato come l’IA stia rendendo le truffe online sempre più sofisticate: deepfake, phishing personalizzato, finte opportunità di investimento e truffe romantiche sono solo alcuni esempi.
 Il documento evidenzia i principali segnali di pericolo, le buone pratiche per proteggersi e le azioni da intraprendere in caso di frode. Il messaggio è chiaro: oggi la consapevolezza digitale è una competenza fondamentale, tanto quanto la sicurezza dei nostri dati e delle nostre finanze.
E' fondamentale quindi che ci siano strumenti che riescano ad analizzare in tempo reale i segnali digitali degli utenti durante il processo di onboarding cosi da avere contezza dell'identità digitale di chi sta interagendo con noi e vuole attivare i nostri servizi.

Sellers and buyers have never been further apart.

Sellers want a pipeline. Buyers want vendors to go away.

Sellers ask, ""What are your strategic priorities for Q3?"" Buyers think, ""I've answered this 14 times this month.""

Sellers run 6-stage discovery frameworks. Buyers just want to know if this thing works.

We've rebuilt our entire sales motion around one idea:

Every stage has 3 things we need. 3 things they need. That's it.

If we can't get ours, we walk. If they can't get theirs, ""walk the plank,"" we shout (we don't). 

No word salad. No, ""let me just understand your vision."" No 47-minute monologue disguised as a demo.

Turns out, when you tell a buyer ""my job is to qualify you out,"" they actually want to talk to you.

But here's what that ""loss"" taught me...

The CEO had everything: 
✓ A problem we could solve 
✓ Agreement he HAD the problem
✓ Desperate need to fix it 
✓ Budget approved

But one thing kept nagging at me.

Every meeting, he'd ask about customization. 
About ""partnering"" to build features.
About source code access. 

Classic Build vs. Buy syndrome.

After our 5th in-person meeting (yes, FIVE), I finally saw it clearly.

This wasn't a buyer. This was a builder trapped in a buyer's process.

His personality screamed ""I'll do it myself."" 
His energy peaked when discussing his team's capabilities.
His questions focused on HOW we built it, not WHAT it could do. 

So I made the call that physically hurt:

I removed it from my pipeline.

My manager: ""Are you SURE?"" 
My financial plan: ""But the commission..."" 
My ego: ""You're giving up.""

Here's what happened next:

→ Freed up 30+ hours that month 
→ Focused on a $1.8M deal that actually wanted to buy 
→ Closed 3 other deals while he was still ""evaluating"" 
→ Finished with my best year ever

And that CEO? 
18 months later, still building. 
Still solving the same problem.

The real lesson?

Not every deal is YOUR deal.

Some buyers aren't buyers—they're builders in disguise. And the time you waste convincing them is time you could spend closing real deals.

Three questions I now ask myself:

1./ Are they asking about outcomes or architecture?
2./ Do they light up more about building or buying?
3./ Is their real goal independence or results?

If the answers point to ""building,"" I'm out. No matter the size.

Because the best deals aren't always the biggest ones. 
They're the ones that actually close.

It helped me hit 120% in 2025.
Here it is (step by step):

This is a longer post so stay patient :D

𝟭. 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹 (𝟯𝟬 𝗺𝗶𝗻). 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱:
My only goal is to answer the 3 Why’s:
• Why anything? (is there a real problem to solve?)
• Why now? (is there urgency or will this drift forever?)
• Why us? (is there an actual fit vs “nice to have”?)

No demos unless it’s a small, obvious use case.

𝟮. 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 + 𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗼:
Second call is where I go deeper:

• What’s the pain really costing? (time, risk, money)
• Who does it impact? (team, leadership, customers)
• What happens if nothing changes? (status quo tax)

If it’s multiple products, I split demo sessions per product.
Cleaner narrative, better stakeholders, less confusion.

And I pull in SEs when needed so the conversation stays sharp.

𝟯. 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗿𝗼𝗼𝗺:
After product demos, I create a digital sales room in Aligned with everything in one place:

• recap of what we agreed on
• decks / PDFs / recordings
• next steps & timeline
• any docs stakeholders will ask for later

This does 3 things for me:

1. Elevates the buying experience (one link, no chaos)
2. Shows me the real deal team (all stakeholders)
3. Shows me engagement (are they actually investing time?)

My experience has been consistent:
If they don’t open the Aligned page, the deal usually isn’t real yet.

𝟰. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗮𝗹 + 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 + 𝗠𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻:
After demos, I present the proposal based on scope and walk through:

1. implementation approach
2. responsibilities
3. timelines
4. what “good” looks like post-go-live

Then we build a Mutual Action Plan together inside Aligned:

• exact steps
• who owns what
• due dates
• dependencies

This is where deals stop being “positive conversations”
and become a project with commitments. Once we reach this stage, my win rate is around 80%.

I don’t judge deal strength by enthusiasm.

I judge it by buyer effort:
Are they reviewing, sharing internally, pulling in stakeholders, moving tasks forward?

That’s why I run my deals this way.

If you’re running complex deals without a shared digital sales room, you’re selling blind.

Fair play, the posts from last week are starting to become very real…

I’m not talking about the, “(insert job role) is dead” ones. 

I’m talking about actual humans pointing out the now glaringly obvious. 

The, “There’s no authenticity any more. Everything is an AI response”

Bullsh*t I thought. Sure, I use Claude and my mate Chat ever single day but surely to god. Know one is actually using it to engage in post comments? You’re taking the p*ss.  

Then I read a very familiar company’s, recent post.

140+ of the most cringe worthy, and blatantly obvious AI auto responses I’ve ever seen. Most of which are them talking to themselves from different company profiles or job roles. 

From the outside looking in, engagement looks enormous. From that post alone, they must have generated a sh*t tonne of leads, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they closed a deal or two off the back of it. 

Knowing what I know though. Not a single piece of it is authentic. 

Somebody. Anybody. Please. Tell me why?

Ps. Happy Monday! This week, I’m asking our awesome SDRs (Elson, Isaac, and Peter Worsley to SLOW DOWN with their outreach. Actually research the person/company you’re calling. If there’s no relevance or you don’t know enough about them before you call/email. Don’t call. Research more.

Your engineers are building the same widgets as your competitors. While your competitive moats sit unexposed.

1.5 billion people use AI daily. They expect every product to work conversationally. But here's what no one tells you about building it:

The multiplication problem.

You add a conversational assistant. Expose one capability-calendar access.

Now you need:

Widget for web
Condensed view for mobile
Text version for Slack
WhatsApp flow
Translation everywhere
Memory across surfaces
Compliance infrastructure

That's ONE capability.

Now expose ten.

Each multiplies across 6 surfaces, 12 languages, dozens of interaction patterns, infinite edge cases.

This isn't one project. It's hundreds of cascading micro-projects.

Here's what makes this devastating:

Every minute building this creates zero competitive advantage 🙃 

Your calendar widget looks identical to your competitor's. Your Slack integration works the same. The compliance layer-they're building it too.

While your engineers build widgets, what's NOT getting built?

The intelligence in your data competitors don't have
The domain logic that creates your moat
The proprietary systems only you control
The AI capabilities that make you 10x better

The real cost isn't time or money. It's fragmentation.

Your team can't concentrate force on competitive advantage because they're fragmented across unpredictable frontend demands.

Without concentrated force, you can't create leverage.

Without leverage, you can't build moats.

The question:
Can your engineers afford to be fragmented across infrastructure when your advantage depends on concentrated force?

The shift has already happened. Where's your engineering capacity going?

Building infrastructure everyone needs identically?

Or building the capabilities that make you 10x better?","Chris Whitehead","activity","urn:li:share:7416616365295439872","2025-11-22","Valid 7416616367271051264","ACoAAARJVp0BgGrpcYntGQ9fOdG9f4psX8Mus0s","ACwAAARJ","ACwAAARJVp0BPj2DCJ0BowOZGgKlRpGn1t1yXS0","ACwAAARJ","✅ Record Found","true",,false

That is how the leading AI video platform, Synthesia, improved voice cloning quality by fixing sound at the source instead of adding complexity downstream.

Their users record wherever they are, on laptop mics in home offices or meeting rooms, often with just 30 seconds of training audio, which means even minor recording inconsistencies can distort speaker identity.

As their Senior Research Engineer, Adam Froghyar, put it: “If we can assume clean inputs, the modeling problem becomes much simpler.”

By integrating ai-coustics at the start of their pipeline, Synthesia standardised audio before training, resulting in clearer and more reliable voice clones. Thanks to Allyson, Adam and the Synthesia team for the great team work on this.

It also shows how physics based acoustic simulation with the Treble SDK enables spatially grounded training data that captures distance, geometry and room acoustics at scale.

If you work with speech enhancement, voice agents or audio AI, this is a practical look at how realistic data leads to more reliable behavior in production systems.

By separating model weights from the SDK, users now download only what they need - no extra files, no wasted time.

This small change makes a big difference: faster installs, modular updates, and a cleaner pipeline for real-time Voice AI.

Quail Voice Focus STT locks in on what actually matters.

Our new real-time primary speaker isolation model doesn’t just “enhance audio.” It identifies, isolates, and boosts the primary speaker, while suppressing competing voices. That means your VAD and STT get exactly what they need: clean, user-first speech.

The payoff:
🔥 Higher STT accuracy
🔥 More reliable VAD
🔥 Smoother, more natural turn-taking

You can now test the SDK for free on our developer portal.

STT accuracy collapses the moment conditions get unpredictable.

Noise, reverb, cheap mics, compression – all break even top-tier STT models. And perceptual de-noisers like Krisp often increase word error rate by stripping away the phonetic detail STT systems actually need.

So we built Quail STT: a speech enhancement model designed specifically to boost STT accuracy in unpredictable and varied real-world environments.

By preserving machine-relevant structure (timing, articulation, consonants, spectral cues), Quail STT consistently cuts substitutions, insertions and deletions across providers.

The result: a relative 10–25% WER reduction across benchmarked data sets.
Quail STT offers:

🌍 Robust performance on noisy, accented, device-variable audio
🤖 Improvements across Deepgram, AssemblyAI, Gladia, Cartesia & ElevenLabs
⚡Models for perceptual SE, STT optimised SE and Voice Activity Detection (VAD) – all delivered through a fast, lightweight Rust SDK.

Spesso scritto da un bot e letto da un altro bot, finisce per essere identico a quello di altri 300 candidati. Risultato? Zero valore distintivo e nessuna indicazione reale sulla futura performance lavorativa di una persona. 

Oggi a fare la differenza sono i segnali non replicabili, ovvero la dimostrazione delle competenze reali di una persona e del potenziale latente che potrà esprimere in futuro: segnali che possiamo analizzare e far emergere con strumenti di assessment pensati appositamente per far emergere chi sta dietro un CV.

Coop Obs Bygg wanted to offer installation as part of their products both in-store and online, which meant scaling across warehouses, installers, and customer journeys without losing control or quality.

They saw Installer.com as the platform to make that possible, getting:

✅ Real-time order transparency with aggregated data and analytics for better decisions

✅ One central platform for installers to manage jobs on behalf of Obs Bygg Montering

✅ A seamless, end-to-end customer journey, fully branded in Obs Bygg Montering’s identity

What’s been especially rewarding to see is how quickly teams across warehouses all over Norway adopted the platform and made it part of their everyday work.

Scheduling is a good example 📚

Routes, availability, skills, customer preferences, it’s a complex optimisation problem that’s still often handled manually 😮💨

During our latest hackathon, we created space for our awesome engineers to step away from the roadmap and explore their own ideas on how to make installations even smoother.

One of those explorations turned into a prototype for smart booking suggestions, where our platform looks at what’s already planned and proposes time slots that actually make sense in a real work day!

Instead of installers manually juggling calendars and routes, the platform suggests booking options based on what already exists in their schedule.

That means:

🚗 Suggestions based on driving time and distance

💡 Options that fit around existing jobs

Household electricity demand is finally growing again. But the leading utilities - like Tibber, Octopus Energy, EDF, and E.ON - aren't just selling EV chargers, batteries, solar and heat pumps for the markup.

In fact, the smartest players know that hardware and installation are often loss leaders.

The real race? Flexibility.

It is a land grab to secure the asset, grow the account, and control the smart meter. The goal is to maximise self-consumption value and lock in long-term ARR through smart tariffs and flexibility services.

But you can't win the race if your deployment is slow or your customer journey is broken.

At Installer.com, we provide the infrastructure to scale this ""land grab"" without the operational headaches.

We help major utilities deliver: ✅ Speed: Access to 4,000+ installer companies. ✅ Visibility: Real-time tracking from order to switch-on. ✅ Conversion: A seamless flow from Hardware Sales ➡️ Installation ➡️ Smart Tariff activation.

Making the switch to electric should be simple. 

But connecting the dots between auto dealers, manufacturers, and installers is incredibly complex.

- How do you ensure the end-customer gets a premium installation experience?

- How do hundreds of separate auto dealers get real-time insight into thousands of jobs?

- How do you build the infrastructure to fuel these networks at scale?

Our friends at Easee and their partner CA Auto Bank have just set the new standard in the UK: bundling charging and installation into a single monthly payment. 

No delays, no friction.

This is the future of installer collaboration.

As many of you have noticed, our content quality has taken a major uplift in the past six months. 

This is entirely due to one person: Magnus Eikemo Stavik. 🌟 

Not only is the quality of his output exceptional, but he also truly embodies the startup mindset. 

When we first started talking, Magnus had already accepted a comfortable role in his hometown of Sandnes. He had just purchased a new apartment, and his life was set. Yet, he understood the vision of what we are building at Installer.com.

Having worked previously at Easee, one of the largest EV charging manufacturers in the world, he resonated deeply with the difficulties of coordinating installer companies delivering installations. He saw the opportunity to transform how businesses and installers collaborate across industries.

Long story short: he took the leap. He sold his newly bought apartment, moved to Oslo, and lived on a tiny bed in my apartment for two months before purchasing his own place here. 

Since then, we have travelled across Europe and the US together.

I know several of us (myself included) are still adjusting to being filmed everywhere we go😅, but the results speak for themselves.

✅ One system for all installation categories, with workflows adjustable in seconds
✅ Real-time visibility of job progress and all communication between installer and customer
✅ Access to more than 4,000 certified installers across Europe and the UK
✅ Fully white-label customer journey – average CSAT of 9.4/10
✅ Brand protection when competition is accelerating these offerings
✅ Access to the most popular hardware brands that your customers would purchase

Volatility is often treated as something random.
A reaction to news, events, or surprises.
In commodities, that assumption breaks down quickly.

Here, volatility is seasonal — because the risks themselves are seasonal.

🌾 Why seasonality matters more in commodities
Commodity markets are tied to the physical world:

 • weather
 • planting & harvest cycles
 • inventory and storage constraints
 • transportation and refinery schedules
 • geopolitics and supply disruptions

These risks don’t arrive randomly.
They show up at roughly the same time every year.
In commodities, the calendar is not just context - it’s part of the model.

📉 Volatility seasonality ≠ price seasonality

This is an important distinction.

Price seasonality is about direction.
Volatility seasonality is about uncertainty.

Prices can go nowhere, while volatility rises predictably.
And options markets know this.

🧠 What the options market already “knows”

Implied volatility in commodities often:
 • rises before known risk windows
 • steepens the term structure into seasonal events
 • shifts skew as downside or upside risk dominates

Options don’t react to seasons - they anticipate them.

That’s why selling “cheap vol” without context is dangerous, and why absolute IV levels are often misleading.

⚠️ What breaks when you ignore vol seasonality

This shows up everywhere:
 • backtests that look great… until the same month every year
 • strategies that overtrade during structurally high-vol periods
 • risk models that underestimate tail risk

Many strategies don’t fail because the idea is wrong, but because volatility wasn’t normalized for the season.

📊 Visualizing it makes it obvious

When you look at volatility across years instead of across time, the seasonality jumps out immediately.

Same market.
Same instrument.
Different month — completely different risk regime.

With Allasso Copilot, you can pull up commodity volatility and see these patterns directly in the data — not as anecdotes, but as structure.

🛠️ How traders actually use this

Volatility seasonality isn’t just interesting — it’s usable:
 • regime filters (high-risk vs low-risk months)
 • dynamic position sizing
 • strategy selection by calendar window
 • comparing current IV to seasonal percentiles, not raw levels

This is especially powerful in commodities, but the same framework applies across assets.

🧭 Final thought

Volatility isn’t flat.
And in commodities, it’s definitely not random.

If a strategy “mysteriously” struggles at the same time every year, the answer is often hiding in the calendar — not the price chart.","Vadim Cissa","activity","urn:li:share:7413889639675060224","2025-11-22","Valid 7413889642757939200","ACoAAAP0l0EBfdHjeVYTbHqo9YOLg939aYhdu6g","ACwAAAP0","ACwAAAF7eikBW3J6AjSa1Kban2FvB5iBESKl8DI","ACwAAAF7","✅ Record Found","false",,false

At risk of dating myself, not every professional options trader out there has access to the live and accurate portfolio greeks and execution algorithms they need to automatically achieve an optimal delta.

At Allasso, we believe in enabling humans in the markets.
Below, we compare and combine classic delta-hedging strategies that can be applied by the rest of us.

We test our hedge strategies in Brent oil against a short, front month ATM straddle that rolls on a monthly basis. We assume execution at settlement prices, using the actual underlying future.

We run this using Allasso’s low-level, iterative Python backtester, Pulse.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘁𝗮 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗜 𝗵𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲?
We’re testing four different measurements of delta:
-Black Scholes Delta, settlement IV
-Quickdelta, settlement IV
-Black Scholes Delta, reduced settlement IV
-Quickdelta, reduced settlement IV
-Black Scholes Delta, historical mean settlement IV
-Quickdelta, historical mean settlement IV

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗜 𝗵𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲?
We are testing calendar- and delta-limit-based rebalancing of the hedge position
-Daily and weekly hedge frequency
-Delta limit for options delta

𝗡𝗼 𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰
Allasso Pulse is a low-level Python coding environment that users can access via hosted workspaces. It puts no limits on the trading logic and gives full access to market data (i.e., implied vols) and strategy state (i.e., delta) throughout the backtest.

Any combination of “what” and “when” can be tested.

𝗛𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁—𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘁𝗮 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝗻𝘀?
In 𝗙𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝟭, the mean values are simply the arithmetic average of the previous 5 observations, which includes the previous straddle deltas. The implied-volatility-reduced ones are based on the last observed implied volatility, minus a 15% haircut.

𝗘𝘆𝗲𝗯𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘀
Let’s look at delta-based methods in 𝗙𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝟮. Weekly denotes every 5th business day after entry or previous re-hedge. Conditional means whenever the options delta exceeds +- 15% of the initial trade size.

𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀, 𝘃𝗼𝗹 𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗱
From the ranking of deltas and frequencies, we would expect to see the best hedge performance from daily hedging of mean-based deltas (𝘀𝗲𝗲 𝗙𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝟯).

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘂𝗽𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗵𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗼𝘄 𝗼𝗳 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘁𝗮
Sifting through all results, it's clear that hedging a rolling average window of delta works the best. 𝗙𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝟰 shows this in the context of unhedged and standard daily hedge, and not vol-normalised. Even without live greeks and automatic execution, the results are far from bad.

The latest Scope 3 Tools Review highlights exactly this tension — adoption is high, but real traction varies. See more details in our blog post! (first comment). Especially relevant if you’re currently evaluating vendors or pressure-testing your setup.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424890660291387392","Yes","Scope 3 emissions: less counting. More cutting.

Did our credo inspire the Scope 3 Peer Group when they summed up where the industry really is right now? Hard to say, but the alignment was striking.

A few takeaways that resonated strongly:
1️⃣ There are big similarities and big differences across industries when tackling Scope 3. One size absolutely does not fit all.
2️⃣ Scope 3 was not a top CPO priority in 2025. And yet, progress is happening.
3️⃣ Suppliers are now being asked for carbon data by customers representing ~33% of their revenues.
4️⃣ Customer pressure is the main driver of SBTi adoption.
5️⃣ Collaboration initiatives have matured: faster, better outcomes, less duplication of effort. 
6️⃣ There are tons of tools, but none of them will fix bad data.
7️⃣ Product-level data sparks endless debate: the “holy grail” for some, “complete bullsh!t” for others. Why the obsession? Because it’s hard and expensive to do well.
8️⃣True leaders go far beyond GHG data: they understand what suppliers are doing on renewable electricity, heat, feedstocks, raw material recycling, and more.
9️⃣ There’s a clear fatigue around data-for-data’s-sake. Everyone wants action and outcomes - even if auditor pressure is still very real.

👏 Congrats to Chris Low, Peer of the Year 🙏 Thanks, Oliver Hurrey : you are quite the community builder! 🚀 And proud to see ctrl+s GmbH  ranked #2 in tool mentions 😊

That the #water challenge is universal.

Last week at WEX Global 2026, I sat down with utilities from Italy, Spain, USA, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, the UAE and many more.

Different networks. Different climates.
But the same urgency.

Managing leak backlogs with limited field teams.
Scaling digital transformation across entire countries.

Balancing infrastructure investments with tight budgets.
What stood out most?

The willingness to learn from each other.
The openness to collaborate across borders.

Water doesn't respect boundaries.
And neither should the solutions.

... A perfect week to look forward to!

I'm excited to be attending WEX Global 2026, taking place in #Seville, 9–11th February, together with my colleague Ritse Klink, Water Alliance and the total #Dutch delegation! 

This year's theme, ""Water, Energy & Climate Change: From Vision to Action – Realising a World of Water Abundance,"" couldn't be more relevant.

What draws me most to this event: one to one conversations. In our work at HULO.ai, we see daily how utilities are balancing urgent infrastructure challenges with the reality of climate stress. The gap between ambition and implementation can feel wide, but that's exactly where collaboration and intelligence matter most.

Water abundance starts with better stewardship of what we already have. Every leak prevented, every network optimized, every decision made faster brings us closer to resilient systems that serve communities and ecosystems alike.

I'm looking forward to learning from peers who are solving real problems in real time, and sharing what we've learned about making water systems more resilient through data and AI. These conversations matter because the challenges we face demand collective wisdom, not isolated solutions. 

Next to that, I'm looking forward catching up with friends that were made during the last two WEX editions. 

Vamos!!!

This week in Brussels, I had the chance to speak at length with EU Commissioner Jessika Roswall (together with Roel Meulepas, Pieter Hoekstra,  Pieter de Jong, and Valentina Chanina)

She’s leading Europe’s Water Resilience Strategy. And it shows.
By pushing for regulation.
And pushing for results.
By setting goals.
And then asking how we actually get there.

Her clarity on the subject lingered in my mind for the last couple of days...

We don’t just need better infrastructure.
We need 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘪𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘵 infrastructure.
We need data that leads to action.
And we need systems that can adapt faster than the climate is changing.

Her focus on investment, implementation, and incentives is exactly what the sector needs right now. Less planning. 𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴.

Europe is no longer asking if water resilience matters.
It’s asking how fast we can make it real.

Burbank's CEO Justin Pike's latest blog shows how the holiday surge in online shopping often leads to skyrocketing fraud, chargebacks and hidden costs; not just for retailers, but for consumers and issuers too. 

At Burbank, we’re focused on helping the ecosystem move toward safer, more certain online payments. Solutions like CPoI® are a big part of that journey 👊 

If you’re thinking about the season ahead, this is worth a read👉 https://lnkd.in/gaxAFDqV

The rise in online fraud at Christmas isn’t just a technical issue. It impacts retailers trying to stay afloat, customers who lose trust, and teams who spend weeks untangling chargebacks that never should have happened in the first place 💳 

One thing is clear. We need online payments to offer the same confidence we see in the physical world. 

If you work in ecommerce, fraud, or payments, or you’re just curious about what really happens when holiday shopping hits its peak, my latest article may give you something to think about 🤔

This week we shared the latest Burbank Software report, Make Trust Pay. The findings show that shoppers are not abandoning checkouts because the deal is poor. They are abandoning because the payment process does not feel safe 🔐 

The data highlights something significant. Trust has become the strongest predictor of whether a shopper completes a purchase, and the gap is widening across age groups.

A few insights stand out:

💳 Only 5 per cent of UK adults feel very comfortable entering card details online
👵 Older shoppers hold the most spending power but feel the least secure when purchasing online
🆔 More than half say identity checks are confusing or off-putting

This shows that trust is not an abstract idea. It is a design challenge. It lives in the small moments where a shopper decides to continue or close the tab.

As we move through the peak shopping season, the question is no longer how fast a checkout is, but whether it feels recognisable, consistent and safe.

Option 1: Refer to a third party -> revenue goes elsewhere. So does the customer's trust.

Option 2: Build it yourself 18 months. Massive budget. New hires. Complex tooling. High risk. Unclear ROI. And your core business isn't cybersecurity.

Option 3: Do nothing Easiest short-term. Expensive long-term. Competitors start offering it. Your ARPU stalls, churn increases

Here's what's missing from this list: a fourth option.

One that doesn't require you to hire security teams, operate a SOC, or explain CVSS scores to your sales people.

But will help you to increase ARPU from your existing SMB customers!

We'll be at MWC Barcelona (March 2-5) showing what that looks like in practice.

If you're attending and tired of those three bad options, let's talk.

La transition énergétique ne se gagnera pas seulement avec plus de MW installés, ni uniquement avec une moindre consommation (et à quel prix ?).

Elle se gagnera avec plus de flexibilité de production, de consommation, de stockage. Cette capacité à produire, consommer, stocker au bon moment, en fonction de la tension du système, des prix, du carbone.

Ce n’est donc pas qu’une question de déploiement massif, et encore moins une question de renoncement. C’est une question d'orchestration. Une question technologique. 

C’est précisément la mission de Tilt Energy : orchestrer la flexibilité pour que la transition énergétique soit efficace, acceptable et industrialisable.

Vuelvo por aquí porque he comprobado que, a menudo, los responsables de Control Interno nos sentimos como una isla dentro de la empresa. Parece que nuestro trabajo es solo ""poner trabas"", cuando en realidad somos el cinturón de seguridad que permite al negocio ir más rápido.
Mi objetivo en esta nueva etapa es simple: compartir métodos prácticos para simplificar procesos que hoy parecen imposibles.
Y para no volver con las manos vacías, os dejo un pequeño ""filtro de realidad"" que aplico cuando diseño un nuevo procedimiento:

La regla de los 3 clics o 3 pasos:
Si para cumplir con un control interno un empleado debe realizar más de 3 pasos manuales o navegar por más de 3 archivos, el riesgo de que el proceso se ignore o se ""hackee"" aumenta un 50%. Menos es más, siempre.

No busco dar lecciones magistrales, sino compartir el camino con quienes creen que el control puede ser sobre todo, eficiente.

Y este cambio tiene un impacto enorme en cómo deben trabajar hoy los Compliance Officers.

La nueva jurisprudencia exige que, para condenar a una persona jurídica, se demuestre un fallo real en su modelo de prevención, no simplemente que un directivo haya cometido un delito.
Es decir:
👉 se acabó el “cumplo porque tengo un manual”
👉 empieza la era del compliance operativo, vivo y medible

Para las empresas, esto supone dos cosas:

1️⃣ Oportunidad: un buen sistema de compliance es ahora una auténtica defensa jurídica ante los tribunales.
2️⃣ Riesgo: los programas de papel ya no sirven. O funcionan… o no protegen.

En icloudCompliance®  llevamos tiempo defendiendo esta idea:
✔️ modelos basados en evidencias
✔️ controles reales y trazables
✔️ canal ético operativo
✔️ monitorización continua
✔️ integración con SGSI, CSRD, riesgos y PBC/KYC
✔️ cumplimiento multirregulatorio en un único sistema

Hoy, la nueva doctrina del Supremo confirma que este es el camino.
El compliance no es un documento: es un sistema.

Si quieres evaluar si tu empresa está realmente protegida con tu modelo actual, estaré encantado de ayudarte.

Seit der News, dass OpenAI die erste „insurer-built“ AI-App in ChatGPT freigegeben hat, ist es DAS Gesprächsthema in der Versicherungswelt: Wird ChatGPT zur neuen Distributionsschicht?

Und jetzt geht auch das Handelsblatt in einem großen Artikel von Tami Holderried und Susanne Schier genau darauf ein. Meine Kollegin Nele Wollert bringt es in einem ihrer Zitate in dem Artikel auf den Punkt: „Sichtbar würden vor allem Angebote, die Nutzer im jeweiligen Ökosystem der KI-Anbieter halten und sofort nutzbar sind.“

Meine 3 Cents dazu:

1) „Approved by OpenAI“ ist für mich kein technischer Burggraben.
Aus meiner Sicht ist das eher ein standardisierter Review/Check als ein exklusives Gütesiegel. Der eigentliche Hebel ist die Distribution: Wer wird sichtbar und wer schafft es, dass der Nutzen in der Konversation sofort erlebbar ist?
 
2) Das ist (erstmal) ein Endkunden-Channel.
Wir reden über eine App, die in ChatGPT läuft – also Consumer-Distribution. Spannend, aber damit nicht automatisch Core Business für viele B2B-/Partner-Modelle. 

3) Trotzdem: ein sehr gutes Signal – und maximaler Druck für alle.
Es setzt die neue Erwartung, dass KI ein fester Teil der Insurance Journey ist. Das pusht ""AI-first“ – und erhöht den Anpassungsdruck auf Versicherer, Makler und Vergleichsportale. Denn Kunden nutzen KI sowieso längst .

Die Frage ist nicht mehr ob, sondern wie schnell wir Produkte & Prozesse KI-ready machen – und in diesen Ökosystemen auffindbar werden.

Wie seht ihr das: App im ChatGPT-Ökosystem, eigene Agenten – oder beides?

Many companies now have impressive Scope 3 dashboards – but still see little real change.

Measuring more doesn’t automatically mean reducing more. Often it just adds complexity, especially for suppliers with limited capacity.

That’s why we built supplier+s to focus on action, not just reporting:
👉 A short, standardized self-assessment suppliers can actually complete
👉 Immediate feedback and benchmarks so they see where they stand
👉 Guided carbon accounting and e‑learning to show what to do next
Lower the barrier for suppliers. Raise engagement. Turn data into real reductions.

So the topic is very much alive – despite shifting policy signals and messy geopolitics.

• Only 36% of corporates engage suppliers
• Only 4% partner with them on actual reduction

The gap? Most approaches treat suppliers as data sources, not partners.
Real progress happens when suppliers see ROI for themselves—not just compliance pressure.

That's why ctrl+s GmbH focuses on trajectory over footprints: 
→ Forward-looking engagement scales
→ Retrospective data collection doesn't

How do you actually drive Scope 3 reductions at scale?

Most companies can model emissions across their full upstream chain. The challenge isn't a lack of numbers—it's a lack of influence.

For most organizations, practical control stops at Tier 1.

But up to 70% of Scope 3 emissions sit beyond Tier 1, embedded in the suppliers of suppliers. That's where most decarbonization efforts stall.

You cannot reduce what you cannot reach.

The path forward isn't about collecting more data. It's about building systems where every supplier—no matter their position in the chain—contributes to measurable progress.

And now €5M to double down.

Beyond compressed air and electricity, data should be the third resource every factory runs on. We're building the pipes to deliver it.

Niklas believed in UMH enough to leave Freigeist after 8 years and join as CCO. Jan built n8n. Jeff co-founded Cloudera. They invested. The people who built tools we admire are betting on us.

e-WNDR helps property owners in the Netherlands switch to sustainable energy with top-quality products from leading brands,  ensuring maximum return on energy use. Committed to learning, open communication, and sharing knowledge, they make sustainability accessible for everyone.

But behind the scenes, e-WNDR faced big operational hurdles:
🖥 Outdated software that made even small updates slow and costly
💸 Reliance on consultancy sessions for simple changes they could have done themselves

Marketing Manager Ace Noppen shares:

“Most of the time, changes in our system took too long, and we had to pay for consultancy sessions, even for easy tasks we could have handled ourselves.”

The solution? OpusFlow.
✅ Freedom to create templates & automate processes without external help
✅ Seamless onboarding that connected multiple systems
✅ More efficient lead management & reduced manual work through automation

Now, E-wndr operates with greater control, speed, and efficiency — all while staying focused on their mission.

We’re excited to share that Sunbeam BV is now fully integrated into the OpusFlow PV-Designer, giving you even more flexibility when creating your rooftop designs.

🌞 Sunbeam BV is a Dutch manufacturer of smart and reliable mounting systems that help installers work faster, safer and more efficiently. Their flat and pitched roof solutions are known for durability, quality and ease of use, which is why so many professionals trust them.

And now, you can use Sunbeam directly inside your OpusFlow designs.
No extra steps. No switching tools. Just select Sunbeam as your sub-structure and continue designing as usual.

A big thank you to the Sunbeam team for the smooth collaboration. 
Jasper Beekmann , Tim Frima

We’re really happy to bring you another option that makes your work easier and more accurate.

Sunbeam is now available in the PV-Designer. 🚀 🌞

I’ve been through iterations, pivots, countless user-interviews, a few prototypes, throwing everything out, and starting fresh as well. I’ve been quiet here on LinkedIn because I’ve been focused on creating something amazing. Now it is time to come out of stealth mode. 

I’m a co-founder of Moventa.io  ( https://moventa.io )

The years I have spent with startups and entrepreneurs I’ve come to accept that most successful founders I’ve met/ talked to don’t have accounting problems. They have a cash management problem.

CASH IS KING was something I learnt at PwC, and in small and medium businesses, it is the lifeblood of the business. It is the third pillar of business finance: P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow statement, yet businesses don’t have good tools to deal with cash outside of a banks horrible UI or a bank manager relationship (don't forget, most businesses bank with multiple banks these days). Big companies can afford high paid treasury professionals to organise and manage cash.

Small and medium businesses get left out in the cold. But not anymore. 

Moventa is focused on helping EU & UK businesses with cash routing-automation, organisation and visualisation.

I’m looking for those who know and feel this pain.

We’re inviting 225 companies to special treatment, founder’s direct contact details and personalised service. Come and support us!

As AI agents move from conversation to execution, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming the default way they interact with real systems. That shift is powerful, but it also changes how identity, access, and trust behave over time.

At Unosecur, we see #MCP as an identity problem before it becomes an incident problem.

If MCP is on your roadmap, this is a shift worth understanding early.

The chart says it plainly: entry wait times can stretch to ~70 days. For banks and Fintechs, that is not just a nuisance. It is execution risk, delayed time-to-yield, and operational overhead when you need to scale staking programs.

Colossus Institutional Hub is built to reduce that operational drag.

What changes with Colossus Digital  
- Operator-agnostic validator management: keep your existing validator operators and custody setup.
- Enterprise controls: policy-guarded workflows, approvals, and auditability.
- Scale operations, not headcount: move from one-validator-per-transaction workflows to batched, automated execution.

Tech details (Ethereum Pectra)
Pectra (May 2025) upgrades the validator stack with:
- EIP-7251: Max Effective Balance to 2,048 ETH, enabling consolidation and fewer validator keys.
- EIP-7002: Execution-layer exits and withdrawals, making lifecycle actions programmable.
- EIP-7702: temporary code for a single transaction, enabling atomic multicall batches, policy controls, and safer large-scale operations without moving funds to a smart wallet.

In practice, this means you can run institutional-grade workflows such as:
- Batch 0x01 to 0x02 switching (1 to 200 validators)
- Batch partial withdrawals (1 to 200)
- Batch EL exits (1 to 200)

If you are planning an ETH staking program or scaling an existing one, we can walk you through the exact operational model and controls.

When a market relies on a single “walled garden”, it is not just an operational choice. It becomes a systemic vulnerability.

We are already seeing this theme show up across major jurisdictions (FCA, HKMA, SEC): resilience increasingly means interoperability.

What this changes for asset managers:
• Your custody stack will diversify
• Your yield stack must diversify with it
• Reporting, controls, and oversight cannot become three separate dashboards

This is why we built Multi Custodian Orchestration at Colossus Digital.

Think of it as a universal remote control for institutional yield: one layer that lets you see, manage, and optimize yield across multiple custody providers (for example Fireblocks, Ledger Enterprise , Dfns ) without turning fragmentation into operational risk.

A European asset manager faced the classic institutional dilemma: generate staking returns or maintain custody control. Not both.

They needed yield across multiple chains. Their custody provider couldn't support it natively. Moving assets off-platform meant unacceptable security and compliance risk.

The solution: custody-integrated infrastructure.

8 weeks to production.
30+ blockchains via one API.
99.9% uptime SLA with senior engineer support.

Assets never left their custody environment. Staking transactions became mathematically provable through the Transaction Lens. Their compliance team could audit every interaction.

Most institutions think hardware wallets are just for cold storage. Ledger Enterprise proved otherwise.

The challenge: How do you enable institutional staking from hardware security modules without compromising the air-gapped protection that makes them secure?

Our integration with Ledger Enterprise solves this through Raw Signing Functions. Transactions are constructed, validated, and signed within the #HSM. The private keys never leave the hardware. The blockchain operations happen seamlessly.

For banks and asset managers, this means:
- Hardware-level security for every staking transaction
- No compromise between cold storage and yield generation
- Full compliance with custody control requirements
- Audit trails that satisfy regulators across EU, US, and APAC

One European Exchange told us: ""We thought we had to choose between security and returns. You showed us we don't.""

That's the power of custody-integrated infrastructure.

The industry just received a massive wake-up call.
Reports late this week confirm that Anchorage Digital is looking to raise up to $400 million ahead of a potential IPO. As the first federally chartered digital asset bank, this isn’t just a funding round; it’s a valuation of the entire ""Regulated Yield"" ecosystem. We are officially moving out of the ""Storage Era"" and into the ""Institutional Utility Era.""

I see this as the definitive end of the ""HODL"" strategy for institutions. In 2026, if your assets are sitting idle in a vault, you aren't being conservative—you're being inefficient.
Three critical shifts are driving this ""flight to productivity"":
Staking is now an Operational Necessity: As Zodia Custody highlighted in their 2026 Outlook, staking has moved from a ""niche yield strategy"" to a core pillar of capital efficiency. With over $110B staked globally, the debate isn't if you stake, but how you do it within a bank-aligned framework. 
👉 https://lnkd.in/dz9wziam
The Rise of ""Auditable Yield"": Fireblocks is closing the gap between on-chain action and off-chain reporting. Their acquisition of TRES Finance means that for the first time, institutional #yield is fully integrated into financial controls. You can now earn rewards and report them to a Big Four auditor with the same click. 
👉 https://lnkd.in/dwbvYuwd
Validator-Level Governance: It’s no longer enough to just ""delegate."" Partners like P2P.org, GlobalStake, Twinstake, Validation Cloud, Solstice, Everstake, SenseiNode and many more are setting the pace with SOC 2 Type II certification, proving that the infrastructure layer is finally meeting the same security standards as TradFi clearing houses. 

At Colossus Digital, we believe the Anchorage IPO and the push for ""Active Custody"" are two sides of the same coin. The market is rewarding professionalization. 
If you are still treating digital assets as a ""side-bet"" in cold storage, you are missing the structural shift of 2026: Digital Assets are now the backbone of the repo and yield markets.
Work with Colossus Digital: Is your 2026 treasury strategy still ""storage-only""? The gap between holding and earning is where the real risk—and opportunity—lies.
I am opening up three slots this week for a 1-on-1 strategy session with Treasury Leads and CROs to audit your digital asset stack for capital efficiency and audit readiness.

Traditional finance taught us you can hold bonds AND collect coupons. Yet in digital assets, most platforms force a tradeoff: keep assets in custody (safe but idle) or move them to validators (earning but exposed).

Custody-integrated staking changes this.

Think of it as collecting yield and rewards while your assets never leave the vault. Your custody provider holds the keys. Our infrastructure routes staking instructions. Validators generate yield. You maintain full control.

30+ blockchains. Zero asset movement. One API.

What custody-yield questions should institutional infrastructure solve next?

#MiCA in Europe. SEC guidance in the US. MAS frameworks in Singapore. Each jurisdiction treats custody, asset classification, and yield generation differently.

Institutions need infrastructure that works across all three without forcing assets out of custody or compromising compliance posture.

That's exactly what custody-integrated staking solves. Assets stay in your existing custody solution while accessing yield across 30+ blockchains, with full audit trails and jurisdictional flexibility built in.

The next era of private capital will be built on solid digital infrastructure, not Excel and OneDrive. 

After almost a decade and a half in private equity, I have seen firsthand how much time is wasted stitching together cap tables, allocations, documents, and reporting that to management, the board and IC.  

The data is there, but it lives in too many places, in too many formats, it takes a lot of effort to reconcile each time, and to make it fit the use case you need it for in that moment. 

Now, as evergreen structures are created, liquidity increases across the chain, and valuations move from quarterly to monthly (or faster), that operational gap matters now more than ever.  

If I walk into a grocery shop, I get a receipt in my phone seconds after I tapped my card. Yet if I’m an LP wiring millions of dollars it takes me weeks to get info over email.  

Connecting the dots is what we’ve been focused on at Dealstack: building the data layer that connects people, entities, transactions, securities, and the legal truth (down to the legal documents) into one interconnected GP universe. 

Today, we’re launching a small but visible part of that progress:

40+ top tier PE sponsors and their advisers trust us already. We keep seeing the same pattern everywhere. 

As sponsors scale and portfolio companies are held for longer, the current operating model means data goes stale, fast:

What’s clear is that the value of T&S is most acutely felt when it has been under-invested in. That gap between effort and visibility is what we explore in this article. It looks at how T&S creates long-lasting business value - and why that value can get lost in translation across cross-functional teams such as Product, Legal, and Finance.

If you too are trying to convey the true impact and ROI of Trust & Safety, perhaps you will find it useful: https://lnkd.in/dQy8mPzK","Julie de Bailliencourt","activity","urn:li:share:7415300458233102336","2025-11-22","Valid 7415312643881861120","ACoAAADQUyMB00-RC5SJslKz2kH-GBc_0-6o4Pw","ACwAAADQ","ACwAAAM9M8kBa4RsJp7_Q6d4WZdKDk4mY242i6o","ACwAAAM9","✅ Record Found","true","Response",true

This is more than a procurement decision. It is a clear step toward strengthening Lithuania’s defence industry and building real, scalable domestic production capacity. As Minister of National Defence Robertas Kaunas 🦬 noted, developing local manufacturing demonstrates the maturity of Lithuania’s defence sector and its ability to contribute directly to national security, while also supporting the strategic goal of expanding ammunition and explosives production.

FPV drone warheads are becoming an increasingly important capability. Compared to guided missiles or manned aircraft, unmanned munitions are typically far more cost-effective, while still delivering a comparable battlefield effect. Just as significantly, they can reduce personnel risk by enabling precise targeting without exposing operators to direct danger.

At LTMilTech, we’re ready to deliver with the standards that this responsibility demands, and we’re committed to ensuring these capabilities are manufactured in Lithuania. 🇱🇹

I lived out of a suitcase last year. From Asuncion to Abu Dhabi, MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in Boston to WFS Seville, I wasn’t just racking up miles - I was trying to break ReSpo.Vision out of the echo chamber.

And I have learned that the best feedback didn’t come from the keynote speakers or the ""visionaries”. It came from the trenches. It came from second-tier coaches fighting for promotion. It came from data leads at federations who are drowning in noise and need actual signal. They didn't just pat us on the back; they challenged our assumptions. They told us exactly where our tech failed to meet their reality.

That feedback hurts, but it’s the only way to grow. We aren't building for a hypothetical market anymore. We are building for the people on the sideline. The industry is moving fast, and the gap between ""cool tech"" and ""useful tech"" is widening. And we definitely learned that utility wins.

All three tell the same truth:

That our tech works at the highest level, trusted institutions believe in us, and now we have the resources to go even faster.

🏅 The FIFA EPTS Certification was huge. It really put us on the map.
Not just because we’re now among a handful of companies globally whose tracking tech meets the highest standards. But because we achieved that with our single camera system. It proved that precision doesn’t always have to come with a six-figure price tag.

🏅 Then our collaboration with the KNVB.
The Dutch federation chose us to provide tracking data for their national teams.
This is one of the most respected FAs in world football, with a reputation for doing things properly. For them to trust ReSpo.Vision felt incredibly validating.

🏅 And finally, our $5M seed round. The real Enabler.
A chance to go faster, hire stronger, and invest more deeply in product and delivery. What made it special was the people who backed us, from deep-tech believers to professional footballers, all sharing the belief that elite-level analytics shouldn’t be limited to elite-level clubs.

So to every federation, investor, teammate, or coach who embraced our technology with an open mind this year, thank you.

This journey started with the idea that you could give top-tier insight to second-tier teams. Now it feels like we’re getting somewhere. 2026, let’s raise the bar again!","Pawel Osterreicher","activity","urn:li:share:7411865366966214657","2025-11-22","Valid 7412051167033053184","ACoAAAL0QjgBQiSlh3PGja2uEh57Ysdxl1Akucg","ACwAAAL0","ACwAAAL0QjgB4mJiRBELx4SJi8wJOcTQnuTcVzY","ACwAAAL0","✅ Record Found","true",,false
,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7404448550350454784","Yes","💡 I was surprised to hear how many top managers are already using ChatGPT.

💬 I’ve had conversations recently where football managers admitted they use generic LLMs just to bounce tactical ideas around. To me, this signals a massive shift. We are moving past the era where data was just for the ""Man Citys"" of the world. With optical tracking and automated analytics, the barrier to entry has collapsed. The technology is no longer the differentiator; the application of it is.

🧠 We are seeing the rise of the ""hybrid operator"" in football - staff who can bridge the gap between sports science, tactics, and AI engineering. Imagine the workflow of that manager I spoke to, but instead of ChatGPT, they are querying a secure model trained on their specific historical data and game philosophy. That is where the edge lies now. My concern for clubs sitting on the sidelines is that AI benefits are compound. You can't just buy this advantage in five years and expect it to work instantly. The clubs building the infrastructure now are creating a ""learning moat.""

📟 The visual below captures exactly why this is happening. We are trading hardware complexity for software intelligence. For years, elite insight was gated behind the cost of multi-camera rigs and heavy infrastructure. That era is ending. As shown, single-camera AI is bypassing those physical/cost barriers entirely, democratizing the kind of data that used to be a luxury. The gatekeepers are gone; the only barrier left is the willingness to adopt.

🤯 For years, I’ve been obsessed with the potential of technology to truly transform competitive sport, not just observe it. It’s a deep, personal passion - the drive to win, the pursuit of an advantage - and that obsession is what led me to ReSpo.Vision.

💡 There is something inherently captivating about the competitive ecosystem of sport. I feel it every day as we work at the sharp end of innovation, proving that what was once considered ""impossible"" can, in fact, be built. This isn't just about code; it's about respecting the complexity of the beautiful game and giving coaches the tools they deserve.

🤖 For too long, the barrier to truly precise player and ball tracking was complexity: huge, expensive multi-camera setups that only the giants could afford. This wasn't sustainable or fair. Our breakthrough - a proprietary, single-camera tracking technology - shatters that barrier. It achieves multi-camera precision in a simple, scalable package, effectively democratizing elite-level insight. This required technical excellence, certainly, but also the conviction to chase a solution where others had given up.

💣 We are part of the global arms race for performance, and it’s profoundly moving to watch organizations fully embrace this new era of insight. The hunger is real. From elite federations to ambitious second-division clubs, they are now engaging with the kind of deep, granular data they simply could not access until now. We are ready to help them transform that deep, innate drive for victory into a measurable, competitive edge.

Además de servirme para profundizar en los retos y oportunidades del sector de la mano de grandes profesionales, aprovecho para resaltar algunos puntos mencionados:

🎯Uno de los objetivos principales de la contratación pública es ofrecer servicios de calidad a la ciudadanía.

📜El reto de la complejidad jurídica derivado de la transposición de la Directiva europea a los 27 Estados miembro, e incluso con adaptaciones adicionales en las comunidades autónomas. Tomo como metáfora las palabras de Chema Gimeno Feliú, quien habló de la “torre de Babel jurídica”.

🤖Como no podía faltar, la oportunidad de la IA para eficientar procesos. Especial mención a la seguridad y a la información sensible que compartimos, además de la importancia de la calidad de los datos con los que alimentamos al modelo.

This week I'm back, and our inbox is a different kind of overwhelming 😀

Since the CDP scores came out recently, the number of companies reaching out to try our free scoring analysis tool is honestly more than we expected.

Teams are trying to make sense of what happened.
-> Why did we drop?
-> Why didn't we improve?
-> We did more this year, how is the result the same?

These are fair questions. And if you follow Anastasia Kuskova here, you've probably seen her explaining exactly why this keeps happening. The way CDP scores and the way most teams think about their responses are just not the same thing.

What beSirius does is take your responses and map them against the scoring methodology, question by question:
-> Where points were gained 
-> Where they were lost

So instead of going through 700 pages of CDP methodology yourself, you get a clear picture of what actually needs to change.

It's free, and this is probably the best moment to use it, while the score is still fresh and there's a full cycle ahead to work with.

His ultimate retirement idea is to create some kind of membership association that hands out accreditations, does very little, and earns a lot.

He hasn’t quite figured out yet how to get it up and running. But I have no doubt he eventually will.

CDP, in the meantime, thought of something even more elegant.

Watch and learn my friends:

-> Charge companies for submitting data

-> Charge companies for accessing submitted data (unless you’re in India, then you just get charged)

-> Charge companies for finding gaps in that data

-> Charge companies for reviewing their data before submission

I’m not sure what’s left to charge for, but give it a year, they’ll find a way.

To be serious though (ha!): gap assessment is THE SINGLE most valuable thing CDP could have properly developed. So please, “register your interest,” because maybe then they actually, at some point, will build it and sell at a reasonable price (a girl can dream). 

In the meantime, if you want your gap assessment NOW, we run a free scoring analysis. Every response cross-checked against CDP methodology, you see clear logic on where points are lost, and get a step-by-step improvement plan. Your path to A-list clear as day

If you look at the results, the number of A-listers almost doubled since 2024 (% as well). Which makes sense. If you keep doing it year after year, eventually you figure it out.

You learn the scoring levels. You learn which questions actually carry weight. You learn what evidence CDP considers sufficient versus what it ignores. You memorize the tier blocking questions and how “awareness” connects to “management” points. You realize that how you frame what you already do is critically important 
And then, slowly but surely, you hit that magic list.

Or you just go to beSirius, let our algorithm cross-reference every response against the CDP methodology, and get a step-by-step improvement plan with a realistic timeline for your A-list. So the Board can carry you like the crowed carried Benito at the Super Bowl. Yo hago lo que me da la gana.

Yes, that’s my firm opinion. The effort is wildly disproportionate to the value you getting. Hundreds of questions, weeks and months of internal work. And for what, exactly?

The only good reason to do CDP is if you don’t need CDP. Your sustainability program is already mature, your data is good, and the A-list score is just a confirmation of what you already know. A byproduct of everything that’s already is being done.

Okay, there’s also a second reason: if you just really, really, REALLY want to be on the A-list. / I mean, everyone has their fixations. Who are we to judge /

Either way, there is NO reason to agonize through the 700 pages of the methodology trying to figure out which ten things stand between you and A score. Life’s too short. The CDP methodology, however, isn’t.

We built a tool that maps your responses against CDP’s scoring criteria and tells you exactly where you’re losing points with a prioritized, timed roadmap to fix them. Some true CDP nerds have already tested it. And loved it (!).

Last year, looking at the same graph shared by Vincent Manier I said the trend was driven by unexpected methodology changes, and that the impact will still persist a year later. Processes don’t change that fast, new metrics can’t be gathered mid-year, and budgets need to be approved way ahead.

And now we are seeing exactly that:

🔷 Companies maintaining poorer scores than two years before, or even dropping further
🔷 Many companies opting out of the assessment altogether

To be fair, another reason companies are opting out (beyond CDP’s methodology extravagance) is the lack of value they get in return for the enormous effort required to submit.

If CDP wants to maintain its position, it urgently needs to learn to be more client/user - oriented. They are too smug to admit own mistakes, too condescending to work with tech companies instead of developing own _not_really_working_ tech, and too full of themselves to even consider that they need to show clear benefits to participating companies beyond a Google folder with a “we are an A-lister!” LinkedIn post.

Companies will keep dropping out unless one of two things happens: the value goes up dramatically (10x) to justify months of work, or the total cost of participation drops enough (3x) to make it a tolerable exercise. Right now, it’s neither.

And if you’re wondering why you still got a B after your perfect submission, check out the beSirius CDP scoring assessment. It has clear heatmaps and specific guidance on what to improve next year. Assuming you decide to stick with it. 🤓

With InsureVision and the new FleetVision offering, safety teams and managers of fleets of all sizes - from passenger ride share vehicles to the largest vans and trucks - can now see huge improvements:

Using state-of-the-art AI, 15x better at predicting claims, InsureVision help fleets turn existing dashcam footage into clear, actionable safety insights:

1.	Automated risk scoring instead of manually reviewing video. Only watch the clips that matter. Not the hundreds or thousands that are simply noise, slow things down and consume significant human resources.

2.	See fleet-wide risk at a glance, spot trends and prioritize coaching.

3.	Lower risk and improved ROI with a simple monthly subscription. 

Most importantly, NO NEW HARDWARE is needed. Most popular dashcam and telematics suppliers supported, including Samsara, Geotab and Lytx, Inc.

And with InsureVision's transformer AI, all of this is possible using forward, road facing dashcam video ONLY.

No IN-CABIN RECORDING IS NECESSARY.

Almost 100 quality conversations with companies looking for ways to make better use of their existing learning and training content, forgotten or hard to find, stuck in proprietary SCORM files and siloed data repositories. Talvi sits on top of all that and cuts through the noise. 

With Talvi (to a large extent leveraging cutting edge AI technology built by Tony Collins & team within the Ailuna family over the last 3 years), enterprises can now realize better ROI at a lower token footprint, and reuse what they already have, instead of continuously having to develop new content. 

Employees find what they are looking for in seconds vs. having to trawl through long forgotten compliance courses. And where are they, anyway?

New content and courses are developed in real time via Talvi's AI, as ""Talvi Nuggets"", based on existing content, addressing current needs from office and front line staff.

But what many don't know is that I have also been involved in endurance sports such as Ironman, ultra running, cross country skiing etc. for almost as long. I've had my ups and downs business wise - and I have had my ups and downs sports wise. 

The endurance learned from going long in sports carries over to determination and going long in business, where things sometimes don't go according to plan. And success in business brings new motivation to one's sports endeavors. 

I have deliberately kept my sports activities off LinkedIn and instead shared what I have been doing sports wise on Facebook and on Strava. But inspired by some of my business friends, who are also involved in sports on the side, I thought I would give those who are interested a view into what I have been through over the years. 

12 Ironman distance races, including Norseman and 5x Ironman Lanzarote, countless shorter distance triathlons, Marathon des Sables 250K ultra run in the desert in Morocco, Cape Wrath Ultra 400K run in the Scottish highlands, several Vasaloppet 90K and Birkebeiner 56K cross country ski races in Sweden and Norway, several 106K XNRG Pilgrim's Challenge ultras, 300K Dragon Ride (Devil route) bike sportive, countless marathons...

And it really didn't begin until I turned 40 where I completed my first Ironman. It's never too late to get started.

So why am I sharing this? 

Really only to say that for some, such as my good friends Keith Williams, Pelle Nilsson, many others and myself, it's what keeps us sane. Although some may find some of what we've gotten ourselves into, a bit insane. For us, it's part of who we are. It's how we leave the business world behind for a few hours, enjoy getting out there and recharge our batteries.

You only live once - and it's all about getting the most and best out of our time and energy on earth. Being inspired by what others do - and that hopefully, what we do, could be inspiring for some, as well.

In case anybody is interested in hearing a little about my journey through sports, I had a chat with Micky Collins on his inspiring ""From Iron Maiden to Ironman"" podcast last week. 

Who would have thought that I would end up on a sports podcast some day? Well, that's what happened :-)

Hope you like it.

""People think how they speak""

The words people choose when they communicate is an excellent proxy to understand people's reasoning skills

Usually for a founder like me, the valuable traits to be avaluated are: 

- Is it able to reverse engineer an objective?
- Is it able to do root cause analyses?
- Is it able to articulate option decisions highlighting cost and tradeoff per each one?

In order to address it, we've added a step in our hiring process that requests from candidate to write one time they had to make a decision by following this template

Il primo report è di Stella (Brenden Delarua) segnalato qui su LinkedIn da Alessia Smeragliuolo (grazie) e pubblicato nel Dicembre 2025.

Il secondo è di Cassandra (Gabriele Franco), pubblicato proprio pochissimi giorni fa.

Richiedono una conoscenza minima della tematica per essere letti, quindi ho pensato di farne una sintesi.

--

👉 Premessa:
Cassandra. Quasi 2 miliardi di investimento pubblicitario analizzato (2020-2025). Diversi mercati e business model. 1.221 modellazioni del Media Mix (MMM) eseguite su 123 brand.

Stella ha analizzato 225 test di incrementalità di brand prevalentemente USA ed Ecommerce (2024-2025). Esperimenti controllati con focus geografico (geo-based).

Due metodologie diverse (e complementari) per rispondere alla stessa domanda: che impatto ha davvero ogni canale?

--

📊 Canali presi in esame:
Quelli che i progetti avevano attivi. Alcuni esempi: Google, Meta, TikTok, Bing, Amazon, Pinterest, Out-Of-Home, Native Ads, Programmatic, ecc..

--

⚡ Punti d'incontro dei due:

📌 Meta: riportano un ROI mediano di 2.94x (Cassandra) vs 2.92x (Stella). Quasi identici.

📌 Suggeriscono di non guardate solo il ROI mediano. Cassandra introduce il ""Risk-Adjusted ROI"" (penalizza l'alta varianza di un canale). Stella parla di ""Coefficient of Variation"" (coefficiente della varianza del canale).

📌 Google e Meta riconosciuti come scalabili, prevedibili, affidabili. 

📌 Suggeriscono un approccio che contempli i canali in base allo scopo/fase. Cassandra li suddivide in Foundation, Growth, Innovation. Stella li clusterizza in Scale Aggressively, Core Performance, Optimize Carefully, Defensive Minimum. Molto differenti fra loro, ma interessante il suggerimento di diversificare di conseguenza.

--

⚠️ Divergenze e differenze

TikTok: Cassandra riporta 2.2x ROI mediano, Stella solo 0.94x (sotto breakeven). Entrambi ammettono che c'è alta varianza, dipende dunque molto dall'esecuzione.

Google: Cassandra aggrega tutto a 4.37x ROI mediano.  Stella scompone in singole tipologie di campagna: Performance Max: 2.98x; Shopping: 1.86x; Search Non-Brand: 1.46x; Search Branded: 0.70x (eh sì, la brand protection non aggiunge conversioni, le ruba altrove).

Pinterest: alta varianza nei dati Cassandra e pochissimi dati per Stella (3 casi) con però ottimi ROI.

--

È necessario ricordare i requisiti di ciascun approccio:

🔹 Per fare MMM servono dati storici consistenti, media mix complesso, e budget significativi. 

🔹 Per fare test di incrementalità serve avere chiara la domanda specifica a cui si vuole rispondere, tempo per eseguire esperimenti (30-40 giorni), e accettare che si sta misurando un elemento per volta.

🔹 Per chi cerca qualcosa di più immediato, tattico e sempre attivo, l'attribuzione multi-touch rimane l'opzione più accessibile (se ti interessa l'argomento: convalytrix.it)

Cassandra has grown from 7 to 20+ people in less than 5 months 

Mostly hiring tech, product and R&D 

Specialized people dedicated to substitute and improve the work done by the co-founders. 

Now we have a cross functional team working together 

The tendency for everyone new, is to join the company and start speaking the language of their domain expertise. 

This phenomena lead to people not understanding each other, running too many meetings, working a lot, but progressing really little. 

This leads inevitably to lack of clarity and frustration in the whole organization. 

The solution is establishing a culture on how cross functional teams need to communicate

2 books that helped me a lot during this process: 

1. Inspired by Marty Cagan (best book on product I've ever read)

2. Pyramid Principle by Barbara Minto (How to present Your Thinking So Clearly That Ideas Jump Off the Page and into the Reader's Mind)

Hope these can be helpful to other founders in the same stage

In addition, I greatly enjoyed reading their latest musings ('Nature at risk, models at fault' - well worth a read if you get the chance), in which they noted that:"" the three realities are: (1) the impact of biodiversity risks to UK economy and financial institutions are equal or greater than climate risks, (2) climate and biodiversity are intrinsically linked and mutual reinforcing, and (3) the outcome of climate and biodiversity pathways are fundamental to understanding the potential state of our future economy and macro-economic impacts to financial institutions"".

The Institute of Sustainability and Environmental Professionals (ISEP) thought similarly in their piece, 'Natural capital is critical infrastructure', and of course the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) agreed in 'Why Nature matters to accountants'. 

So all agreed that Nature matters, but how do we make it an attractive proposition to institutional investors?  Well we could start by talking in a familiar language about risks and returns.

A expresarse en una línea con palabras clave. 
Como los tuits de 1️⃣2️⃣0️⃣ caracteres del antiguo Twitter, pero en modo hardcore 😳

💬 Creemos que ahora sí que toca un cambio paradigma: hablar con la tienda. Explicar lo que necesitas. Refinar sin empezar de cero. Como ya hacemos fuera del eCommerce. 

Eso es lo que estamos construyendo en Kimera Technologies: 
una nueva forma de buscar, no una optimización de la anterior.

Un buscador conversacional. 

Que combina lenguaje natural, inteligencia conversacional y computer vision (hay que “entender” el producto como un humano, y eso solo es posible si realmente “lo ves” más allá de la descripción). 

Gracias a Adara Ventures, Bonsai Partners, Addendum Capital y al resto de nuestros inversores.

En 1998, Yahoo era el rey indiscutible de la búsqueda en internet. Más de un 80% de cuota. Ese mismo año Google lanza su motor de búsqueda.

La revolución de Google fue sencilla de explicar: podías buscar mejor. Mucho mejor. Mejores resultados con menos esfuerzo. ⚡

Poco a poco Yahoo fue perdiendo terreno, con un Google imparable que acabó convirtiéndose en el monopolio de facto de la búsqueda.
Luego esa tecnología saltó a la búsqueda de productos DENTRO de un eCommerce 🛍️: primero muy básica y ruda, luego Elastic, luego algo más de innovación intentando emular a Google… 

20 años después, algo vuelve a moverse. De forma inesperada, los LLMs empiezan a arañar cuota al inexpugnable Google. 

🤖 Pedirle a ChatGPT / Perplexity / etc. que nos busque cosas ya no es raro (¡y solo han pasado 2 años desde que empezamos a jugar con ChatGPT 3.5!). GEO (además de SEO) empieza a entrar en el vocabulario del eCommerce. 

🗨️ Y ahora es imposible no ver un paralelismo. Eso de hablarle al buscador, ¿se quedará solo en la búsqueda de Internet? ¿Seguro que no llegará también al eCommerce? 

Pues justo eso pensamos en Kimera Technologies. Y por eso creamos un buscador conversacional: para que los compradores puedan vivir esa experiencia de buscar conversando. DENTRO del eCommerce.💬🛒

PD: Las conversaciones con eCommerce Managers están siendo muy alentadoras. También lo ven. Quizá es el comienzo :-D 🚀

 Y además, evitar riesgos, claro, para no fallar.

Me llevó tiempo darme cuenta de que no va de eso.

Va de tener un sistema que te ayude a tener buen juicio.
 🧭 Que use los datos.
 ⚖️ Que valore urgencias, impacto, consecuencias, reversibilidad, adaptabilidad.
 🔍 Que te exponga a perspectivas distintas.

Buscar con ChatGPT o sus primos. Es comodísimo. Describir lo que quieres tal cual lo dirías a una persona.

Lo curioso es 👉
🔹La mayoría de los eCommerce Managers ni se ha planteado que ese mismo cambio tenga sentido… dentro de su tienda.
🔹Seguimos asumiendo que el cliente va a buscar con 2–3 keywords porque “es lo que se ha hecho siempre”. 

Pero después de usar IA para buscar en Internet, esa forma de buscar se siente vieja 👴🏻
Si puedo hablar con una IA para encontrar cualquier cosa en Internet…
 👉 ¿por qué no puedo hacer lo mismo cuando quiero comprar algo en un eCommerce concreto?

Para mí, ahí está el punto ciego.
 Y también la oportunidad.

📍Los mantras del management NO son correctos. 
Los mantras son sobre-simplificaciones. 
Y el mundo real es inherentemente complejo.  
Y como el mundo es complejo, sobre-simplificar es un error. Siempre. 

Piensa en los refranes populares. 
Al que madruga, Dios le ayuda ¿No?
Y sin embargo, “No por mucho madrugar amanece más temprano”.

Del mismo modo, la contrapartida de “!Acción ya!” sería
“Mide dos veces, corta una”.

En lugar de elegir entre dos mantras sobre ""acción"", ambos erróneos, mejor usa esta guía de 4 parámetros que tener en cuenta:
1️⃣ Urgencia de la decisión
2️⃣ Impacto de actuar y de no actuar ahora
3️⃣ Consecuencias de la decisión. ¿Reversibilida? ¿Reorientable y cuánto?
4️⃣ Nivel de datos disponibles ahora, y qué implicaciones tendría tener más. ¿Tiempo? 

Reflexionar usando estos cuatro parámetros te ayudará a pasar de la parálisis o el impulso ciego a la acción con propósito.
✅ A tomar mejores decisiones.

Por cierto, ya que estamos. En Kimera Technologies pensamos que evaluar si un nuevo buscador de productos puede mejorar las conversiones debería ser un proceso que 
- lleve poco tiempo y esfuerzo
- reversible y sin implicaciones
- que proporcione datos relevantes. 
En cuanto a la urgencia... ¿qué supondría si las conversiones mejorasen ahora?

Arcos de catedral 
———
Todavía recuerdo la primera vez que oí la expresión “arco de catedral”. Telco joven y disruptiva (que poco después fue comprada por una grande en una de las habituales consolidaciones). 
Lo decía el CIO. Y la usaba peyorativamente describiendo una solución grande, gorda, pesada. Matar moscas a cañonazos, vaya.

Quickwin 
———
Ya sabes lo que es. Pero NO le das la importancia que tiene. La primera vez oí eso fue cuando el CEO de esa misma empresa me explicó que distinguir una cosa de la otra (y ponerlo en práctica) era una de las claves más infravaloradas en el mundo empresarial. 

Nos dejamos llevar por la intuición, por el pensamiento rápido (gracias, Kahneman). Bueno, también hay alguno de los 100 excels, pero se suele pecar más de lo primero.

📍¿Quickwin para identificar quickwins? :😅
———
Tablita muy sencilla. Pero hay que hacerla. 📊 
Lista alternativas. Puntúa facilidad de implantación y eficacia en resultados en columnas diferentes. Si hay más criterios muy relevantes, ponlos también.

Y de repente lo verás todo mucho más claro.

Luego lo puedes complicar si quieres. Ponderar cada columna. Riesgos. Qué pasa si sale mal. Coste. Ya sabes...

No te pases de complicar. Verás que la mayor parte del valor surgirá del propio proceso de reflexionar y obligarte a ponerlo por escrito.

Y tendrás más claros los quickwins. 
Y los arcos de catedral. 
Y evitarás confundirte.

PD Ya que estás, hazte una tabla de quickwins para tu eCommerce. Y pon en una de las filas considerar si el buscador va bien. A veces te llevarás una sorpresa. 🚀

En general, lo más frecuente es que el buscador de un eCommerce ya se considere como “resuelto”. 

Y es normal. Hay muchas prioridades que atender. Que requieren atención. Que son urgentes. Importantes. El equipo se siente como uno de esos músicos multiorquesta, con la guitarra, el bombo a la espalda, la armónica en el cuello y los platillos en las rodillas… 🎺🥁

Sin embargo, es muy común que haya búsquedas que no funcionen bien. 

❗ “Colágeno en pastillas” que te devuelve una pastilla de jabón que favorece la generación de colágeno. 🤦‍♂️

El problema es que, como esa búsqueda ha proporcionado resultados, el error no aparecerá nunca en ningún informe. Será una aguja en un pajar de miles de búsquedas. 

Claro, la duda surge: ¿cuántas búsquedas más, como esa, habrán tenido lugar? Búsquedas que dan resultados, pero que son erróneos.
Y lo que hemos visto es que, efectivamente, es muy común. Y puede estar costando no pocos puntos de conversión. 

En Kimera pensamos que este era un problema que había que resolver.
 Y construimos un buscador que entiende lo que el cliente pide y entiende lo que el producto realmente es, como lo haría un humano.

Para que “colágeno en pastillas” encuentre colágeno en pastillas.

Negli ultimi mesi ho avuto modo di partecipare a molti convegni o tavole di discussione sulla (tanto agognata) trasformazione digitale. 
La cosa che mi stupisce di più è che nel 2026 ancora, alti dirigenti di azienda, usano le parole “#tecnologia”, “#innovazione” e “#intelligenzaartificiale” come se fossero sinonimi. Ma perché? E soprattutto, cosa si nasconde dietro questa osservazione?

Facciamo un po' di chiarezza, con esempi semplici (semplicistici per gli addetti al settore tecnologico) e tendenti al banale💡

1. Tecnologia è la base: significa dati affidabili e accessibili. Esempio banale ma concreto nel mondo #retail: la fidelity card, gli scontrini, le rotture di stock, i resi, le promozioni, i reclami. Se questi dati sono sparsi, incompleti o non “parlano” tra loro, qualsiasi progetto si ferma.

2. Intelligenza artificiale è lo strumento che lavora su quei dati. Esempi concreti (quasi tendenti al banale nel 2026): previsione più precisa della domanda per ridurre invenduto e out-of-stock; suggerimenti di riordino per negozio; promozioni personalizzate per ogni carta fedeltà.

3. Innovazione, infine, è il processo con cui trasformi queste capacità in un nuovo modo di lavorare: nuove decisioni, nuove responsabilità, nuove metriche. Non è un software: è cambiare l’operatività.

Cosa dicono i numeri: la mancanza di #competenze frena quasi il 60% di chi ha valutato di investire in progetti ad alto contenuto tecnologico. 
La competenza è fatta di studio e di interesse: se i decisori delle aziende sono i primi a disinteressarsi del tema, un'organizzazione non potrà mai avere una cultura dedita all'innovazione 🧭

Il retail dovrebbe smettere di essere “chi vende prodotti” e diventare “chi vende meglio grazie ai dati”. Problemi di produttività di negozio, assortimenti non performanti, prodotti non disponibili e prezzi non competitivi sono tutti figli di un unico grande problema: la mancanza di una visione oggettiva e data-driven.

La priorità attuale (e non di piani industriali futuri) è chiara: alfabetizzazione dei manager + dati messi in ordine + casi d’uso semplici e misurabili.

Le tecnologie che stanno trainando questa crescita sono soprattutto:
- Machine Learning
- Generative AI
- Natural Language Processing

Strumenti che iniziano a entrare nei processi di PMI, manifattura, servizi e industria tradizionale. L’AI diventa così un abilitatore concreto di efficienza e competitività.

This year has been intense. It is difficult to ignore a world that feels increasingly volatile—where access to critical raw minerals is often at the heart of global tension.

Amidst these challenges, I feel fortunate to be part of a story that is positive and purposeful.

2025 was a particularly special year for me. I joined the PhaseTree journey on the first day of January. Building a high-growth deep-tech startup in Materials Science is a serious undertaking; it is genuinely tough work that requires total precision. But for me, it is deeply meaningful because we are committed to a higher purpose: impacting society through better-performing materials.

Materials are the foundation of everything around us, from basic infrastructure to the future of robotics. Ultimately, the performance of any product is limited by the physical material itself. This is why we use our ""𝐏𝐡𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭, 𝐀𝐈 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨𝐩"" approach to discover what’s next. We are proving that grounded data is the only reliable path to discovery. You can read more about the essence of our approach here: https://lnkd.in/eDaV5drw

It has been a tremendous year at PhaseTree, marked by milestones that the whole team should be proud of:
✅ Securing €3M in funding led by Heartcore Capital
✅ Tripling our team in less than a year
✅ Joining the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) program and receiving the Innobooster grant.
✅ Officially releasing our simulation software and signing our first major industrial partners

We didn't make our AI Router standalone because of a roadmap decision. We made it because the market kept sending the same signals, and eventually they became too loud to ignore.

Here's what we kept hearing:

60%+ of our customers we spoke with were already routing. Built in-house, cobbled together, quietly draining engineering time. Not because they wanted to build infrastructure but because nothing purpose-built existed for them.

European teams were asking harder questions than most. Not ""which model performs best"" but ""where does inference actually happen?"", ""which providers are in our critical path?"", ""how do we change that when regulations shift?"" Sovereignty stopped being a policy discussion. It became an architectural decision.

And when we looked at enterprise adoption patterns, the picture was consistent. Teams weren't struggling to find good models. They were struggling to stay in control as the number of models grew. More than a third of enterprises now run five or more LLMs in production. The complexity compounds fast.

What tied it all together: enterprises don't want another point solution. They want optionality. The ability to start small, stay in control, and adapt as the landscape changes without committing to a full platform before they're ready.

Routing is exactly that. A lightweight entry point that solves a real production problem on day one.

We’re glad to see orq.ai mentioned in Gartner’s Market Guide for AI Evaluation and Observability Platforms (published February 2, 2026).

The guide underscores why evaluation and observability are becoming essential:
• GenAI systems are nondeterministic, making traditional testing unreliable
• Production behavior matters – failures and drift only show up at runtime
• Teams need continuous evals, combining offline testing with live signals to track quality, safety, and reliability

That direction mirrors why we built orq.ai in the first place. To help teams evaluate, observe, and improve AI systems across the full lifecycle, not just before deployment.

This market is still early, but the shift is already underway. Teams that invest in eval-driven development today will be the ones shipping AI they can actually trust tomorrow.",,"activity","urn:li:share:7425100216304889857","2025-11-22","Valid 7425132838674403329",,"","ACwAAAmYMdIBrxIHDmQ_G3EG_VZfOIWWStJqd4g","ACwAAAmY","✅ Record Found","false",,false

Not in a metaphorical sense, but in very practical ways.

They will have costs, performance variance, failure modes, governance needs, and ownership questions. The economics of agents are very different from human teams, and if enterprises don’t proactively manage this, things can spiral quickly.

That’s one of the themes I am personally curious to explore in this upcoming discussion with orq.ai, Miyagami, Lleverage, and AdamI on where agentic AI economy is heading in 2026 at Zoku Amsterdam, and what teams should start preparing now, not later.

The ambition for AI is huge, but the ability to get it into production is painfully limited.

The demos look great. The prototypes are promising.
However, the moment they encounter real data and operational complexity, accuracy drops, behavior becomes unpredictable, and teams lack a structured way to diagnose or improve performance.

Without a framework for evaluation, iteration, and continuous learning, projects often stall, and most AI initiatives never progress beyond the prototype stage.
This gap between building AI and actually running AI in production is where so many companies get stuck and it’s exactly the space where orq.ai operates.

What excites me about orq.ai is how intentionally we’ve built a unified control layer for AI agents: a platform where teams can design agents their own way, evaluate them with real signals, monitor behavior, and deploy with full clarity over data and governance. All in one place, all built for the realities of enterprise environments.

As someone who cares deeply about transforming complex ideas into operational systems, this mission resonates strongly, and it has been inspiring to see how customers across Europe and the US are already utilizing orq.ai to transition from experimentation to real-world production.

I spent this week up in our Harrogate office with the team, meeting new faces and working through our strategy for client onboarding and operational excellence, led by Kyle Basnett.

The best client relationships in hospitality tech don't start with a product demo. They start with a conversation.

That's why we're obsessed with getting the technology implementation right, and getting it right for each operator. Not because we're in a rush, but because the sooner the platform is humming in the background, the sooner we can focus on what actually matters: understanding your business.

Your culture. Your guests. Your specific challenges. The details that don't fit neatly into a 'feature list' or an 'off the shelf product'.

Technology should create space for these conversations, not consume it.
We're Grateful for every partner who trusts us with their operations. And we don't take that lightly. We've got some exciting developments in the pipeline that will take personalisation to a whole new level for both new and existing customers.

Because the hospitality businesses that win aren't the ones with the most tech. They're the ones with the right tech, and partners who actually understand what ""right"" means for them.

Today’s news re consultation on strengthening tipping legislation is another step in the UK’s journey to put employee voice and transparency at the centre of how tips are handled. The direction of travel has been clear for a while, from ensuring 100% of tips go to staff, to now requiring active consultation with teams when creating and reviewing tipping policies. Signalling: 

- More accountability
- More transparency
- More ways for employees to be heard

Thankfully, we’re doing most of this already. Simultaneously, the team have been hard at work in the background on building, and listening to bring something to market that makes it easier than ever for employees to have a voice, and for operators to track, evidence and stay compliant with ZERO friction.

That makes sense, they’re the face of the experience.

But great hospitality is built long before food hits the table or a pint is pulled. Better-motivated teams deliver better service. Period.

And that takes chefs, bar teams, runners, porters, and managers working as one.

Hospitality is a team sport. Rewards should reflect that.

So here’s the real question: Are we incentivising what guests see, or what actually makes great hospitality happen?

That said, we’ve heard supportive words before. I’ll hold off on final judgement until we see real, practical changes that actually help businesses on the ground.

Working closely with hospitality operators every day, this feels long overdue.

Costs keep piling up, wages, energy, food, rent, and business rates have been another heavy burden, especially for pubs, bars, and restaurants that sit at the heart of local communities.

The industry has been saying this for years so it’s encouraging to see signs that someone might finally be listening. That said, this can’t be a one-off fix.

What hospitality really needs is:
- A PROPER rethink of business rates
- Ongoing, meaningful dialogue with operators
- Policies that reflect how hospitality actually works day to day

Hospitality businesses are resilient and adaptable, but they can’t keep absorbing everything alone.

Feels to me that this marks a step in the right direction.

Curious to hear from others in hospitality, does this feel like real progress?

More and more hotels, coworking spaces, gyms, and restaurants are backing local businesses instead of competing with them.

Instead of trying to do everything themselves, they’re pointing guests to great nearby cafés, restaurants, gyms, and galleries. Some are even teaming up on guest perks, free drinks, set menus, or little extras you wouldn’t find on your own.

Earlier today, in her speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that the EU will create “a new truly European company structure.”

 “We call it EU Inc,” she said. 🚀 

We cannot emphasise enough how much this means for the people who’ve helped turn the idea of a EU-wide company framework into an increasingly certain reality. 

That means you, and everyone who wants a better future for Europe, and more of a chance for the EU to regain its footing in the global innovation race.

While we eagerly await the actual legislative proposal from the European Commission (poised for March 2026), we are truly grateful for the support that has already been given to us by its President, many Commissioners and other supporters from across the EU institutions.

Europe desperately needs its founders, more than founders need Europe. 

EU-INC will enable and empower entrepreneurs and investors to think bigger and act faster, right here in Europe. That’s the real ambition, and our only agenda.

So yes, President Von der Leyen, we do call it EU-INC. 
Just stylised a bit differently. ;)

Now let’s get it over the finish line together.

Great explainer video in the comments: It perfectly shows why so many European startups incorporate directly in the US or later move their HQ there: Integrated capital markets vs. fragmentation and heavy bureaucracy here in Europe.

At 3D Spark, we feel that pain too. If commercial reality forces us one day, we might move our HQ to the US.

• One pan-European legal entity
 • One EU-level registry — fully digital incorporation within 24h 🤯

Ich bin in Dubai auf einer Messe und abends mit der Metro gefahren, nichts Besonderes.

Bis mir heute ein Kunde aus Japan (ein Bauleiter mit dem ich schon seit 2 Jahren zusammenarbeite) erzählt, dass er vor 16 Jahren genau an dieser Metro „red line“ mitgebaut hat. Dass er einer derjenigen war, die dafür gesorgt haben, dass dieses Projekt überhaupt entstanden ist. Und plötzlich bekommt so eine alltägliche Fahrt eine emotionale Tiefe: Jemand, den ich gut kenne, hat dieses Stück Infrastruktur mit geschaffen und erzählt ganz stolz von dem Projekt.

Diese Verbindung zu Projekten – die Nostalgie, der Stolz, das Gefühl, etwas Reales hinterlassen zu haben – ist für mich einer der schönsten Aspekte dieser Branche 🤝🏗️

Das empfinde ich interessanterweise auch oft bei Projekten die unsere Software genutzt haben (specter automation ). Auch wenn wir nicht selbst auf der Baustelle stehen, begleiten wir Projekte, unterstützen Teams und tragen unseren Teil dazu bei, dass Bauvorhaben effizienter und einfacher umgesetzt werden 💡🔧. Jedes erfolgreiche Projekt fühlt sich an wie ein kleiner Beitrag zu etwas Dauerhaften.

Komischerweise hat mir eine Bahn in Dubai und ein Bauleiter aus Japan das heute wieder klar gemacht ❤️","Emanuel Groh","activity","urn:li:share:7399102472612519936","2025-11-22","Valid 7399102473707360256","ACoAABtv1z8BI3sdOQiqAc1gbxNPr-M6fp_7UOo","ACwAABtv","ACwAABtv1z8Bs4Zsl8BIrKcSLJSWZaR130pBIwI","ACwAABtv","✅ Record Found","false",,false

It’s a complex, fast-moving space with huge potential. Within that, there’s one company I’ve been watching closely, impressed not just by its growth, but by how it keeps people at the centre of what it’s building.

Which is why I’m delighted to share that I’ve joined Yavrio - Open Banking as Chief Revenue Officer.

Over the last 18 months, Yavrio has grown at incredible speed, expanding its capabilities, partnerships, and presence across the Microsoft ecosystem. What made this feel right, though, was the team. Smart, ambitious, and building with real clarity at a point where focus and momentum genuinely matter.

Having founded and exited businesses, and then helped scale one through its next phase, this feels like the right moment to step into something exciting again. To roll up my sleeves, bring together revenue, partnerships, and go to market, and help shape what comes next.

Every story has different chapters and this really feels like turning a fresh page - bringing new energy, new challenges, and the chance to build again in a way that feels very aligned with where I am now.

I’m so excited about what’s coming. I’ll be out and about catching up with people, sharing more about this next adventure, and bringing you along for the journey, so feel free to drop me a note if you'd like to chat.

As it grew, I myself have grown in ways I never believed possible and I am a very different person from the one who started that initial journey. 
 
With the support of many of you, those years have been filled with some amazing accomplishments - from winning multiple global Microsoft awards, working with huge household brands, and a successful acquisition of the original company. 
 
As it evolved into Ingentive I then stepped into the CMO role to bring my longstanding focus on partnerships and alliances to help shape, influence, and grow the business. I have learned so many new skills and have had the privilege to work with some amazing people within and without the organisation at a time of huge technological shifts in the world. 
 
But every story has a beginning, middle and end, all equally exciting in very different ways. Which is why, after a lot of thought, I decided that 2026 would mark the end of my journey with Ingentive. This was never an easy decision, it’s been a huge part of my life, but sometimes the right thing is simply knowing when it’s time to turn the page.
 
I’m very excited about what’s next and look forward to sharing more. A new adventure, new energy, and the chance to build again in a different way utilising the skills I have gained in building fast growth technology businesses. 
 
In the meantime, to those who have been part of this journey at every stage, who have helped me grow, helped me learn, helped me up, and pushed me forward… I just want to say a huge thank you!","Margaret Totten (MCIM)","activity","urn:li:share:7421595882862759936","2025-11-22","Valid 7421595884636778496","ACoAAAb0RjwBLpo057sTR54pXn23F075PnBWCp0","ACwAAAb0","ACwAAAb0RjwBpqun53ZCDGaGvsjkbO26T0iOALE","ACwAAAb0","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Am e.g. using Claude Code for video animations. Very powerful.

But: Without paying attention, it can get risky quickly.

As you can see in the pic:

Claude Code decided to auto download a package it needed for image enhancement. I had not given Claude permission to do so..

This is a great example of the inherent challenge with agents:

-> Agents will only unfold their full potential if we let them act autonomously. Meaning: let them connect to other systems. And come up with paths to solve problems.

-> Still, someone has to control (review) these permissions. And this layer is entirely missing today.

In other words:

For broad agent adoption, we have to get the authorisation model right.

This must include:

-> Delegation: Who introduced the agent? And with what basic scopes?
-> Dynamic permissions: What scopes does an agent identity need per job?
-> Audit trail: How can we keep track of each agent job (and the respective dynamic permissions)?

-> “AI agents can read and modify third party systems with static access and broad scopes.”

-> “An agent by nature will always do whatever it takes in order to complete its task.”

-> ”It might decide to download certain packages without your prior permission. It might mean that it goes to a third party database and deletes certain data (…) or start sharing some of your secrets.”

Do you know?

Controlling AI agent access is: THE new big frontier in identity management.

The traditional security model will not fly to control AI agents.

NON-AI WORLD:
-> Identity: One known identity (the human) 
-> Access logic: Access to one system → Permissions: Static
-> Auth: Usually via SSO

AI WORLD:
-> Identity: Non-human (often with sub agents) → Access logic: Multiple system-to-system accesses per agent 
-> Permissions: Should be dynamic/job-based (not the case today, big issue!) 
-> Auth: Today mostly via API key or OAuth (but that can’t be the solution)

STILL, TO GET GOING, COMPANIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE FUNDAMENTALS:

If it weren’t so serious: it’d be a super fun story.


WHAT HAPPENED?

OpenClaw (Clawdbots) is an open source AI agent for tedious tasks. Went viral.

People install it on their laptops. And give it unrestricted access to:

Email, files, calendar, browser, shell, secrets.

The agent then autonomously downloads new skills.

Which can (via the shell/terminal) create new sub agents. With the same access permissions as the parent.


YOU GET THE POINT ALREADY, BUT THEN:

150,000 of these agents joined Moltbook (Reddit for AI agents).

Here they started sharing secrets, like API keys.


THINK OF IT LIKE THIS:

You’re inviting people you don’t know to your house party.

They can invite other people. Door’s wide open.

Your “guests” can walk into all rooms. Access your online banking.

Not the model.
The follow through.

On 3 February, I am joining Johannes Keienburg (PhD) for a conversation on scaling access management in 2026, without growing your IT team to explore this topic in depth. 👇

Access is now created everywhere:
• AI agents
• apps
• teams
• vendors

And that is exactly why RBAC still matters.

RBAC is one of the highest ROI controls in security.

When it is adopted well, you get:
• faster onboarding, because access is packaged
• fewer mistakes, because permissions are predictable
• cleaner audits, because you can explain who gets what, and why
• safer change, because you remove one off grants

The downside?

RBAC is a program, not a document.

It fails when it becomes “write policy, ship policy, forget policy.”

If you want RBAC adoption, do this:
1. Start with the 10 roles that generate 80% of access
2. Build roles around outcomes, not titles
3. Keep roles small, then combine them like Lego
4. Put ownership on the business, not only IT
5. Tie access to joiner, mover, and leaver, so it stays current
6. Review roles on triggers, not a calendar reminder

RBAC does not need to be perfect.

It needs to be usable.

Data silos are the death star for everyone who’s managing access.

IT, Security, Ops and HR teams are constantly searching for access data in:

→ Their IDP 
→ Their HRIS 
→ Their company access inventory 
→ Extra access spreadsheets of their teams

And then, there’s ALL the access they don’t even know...

This is causing a massive lack of visibility. And huge amounts of manual work.

Specifically in fast-moving companies, where access is highly dynamic.

This is why we’re launching LIVE ACCESS SYNC: A new powerful layer of real-time access data consolidation in Cakewalk.

This is how it works:

1/ Select the respective application in Cakewalk 
2/ Connect it and activate the sync 
3/ Cakewalk will then sync user data from the app in real time

And, as always in Cakewalk: It takes seconds to set this up.

LIVE ACCESS SYNC is our next step in building the agentic Identity Governance platform for fast-moving companies. Consolidating all access data in one system of record. And automating all access control workflows for no-touch IGA.

But it varies greatly across countries, jurisdictions and courts. This is something we obsess over at Pandektes, as we're focused on building the largest legal database in existence.

In practice, only a fraction of case law makes it into the databases legal professionals rely on every day, and sometimes even there they remain difficult to surface.

Recent German research by ARD’s legal editorial team and the SWR Data Lab looked at German civil and administrative court decisions from 2023 and 2024.
The results are sobering:

The nationwide average of published decisions is 3.5%. Some states publish as little as 1.5%. 

Several regional courts published none at all.

Many courts consider routine cases irrelevant for publication. A large share of court work is seen as repetitive, mass business. 

What is relevant and not relevant is an interesting discussion, and something that should be continuously addressed along with the development of technology.

But there is also a practical bottleneck: time and staff. Every decision must be anonymized before publication. In many courts, that still happens manually.

For practitioners this has the possibility to create a distorted picture of reality. Legacy databases show a limited part of jurisprudence. As we do not have all the data, we do not know the unknowns.

This inconsistency and lack of completeness is part of what we're solving in Pandektes.

Legal intelligence has a data problem. In order to take legal research and analysis into the future, we need a better and more complete data infrastructure. 

That's what we're building at Pandektes.","Casper B. Laursen","activity","urn:li:share:7429897501748551681","2025-11-22","Valid 7430143605975080960","ACoAACArp4IBm6-iJuk27toTv3YYJYxNxfyQMbg","ACwAACAr","ACwAACArp4IBftpKZExunfzlBtUjyu6rO-bwPx4","ACwAACAr","✅ Record Found","false",,false

Elektrificatie zorgt voor een ander verbruiksprofiel bij huishoudens en bedrijven. Denk aan laadpalen, warmtepompen, batterijen en extra opwek via zonnepanelen. Dat legt druk op aansluitingen op het laag- en middenspanningsnet en vraagt om slimmere keuzes achter de meter.

Tijdens de workshopronde verzorg ik names Tibo Energy Management Software een sessie over achter-de-meter optimalisatie met de titel: van vaste regels naar voorspellende sturing.

È iniziato con L'arte della vittoria di Phil Knight, il fondatore di Nike. Un libro che ogni tanto riprendo in mano e sfoglio.

Phil Knight vendeva scarpe giapponesi dal bagagliaio della macchina. Ha rischiato di fallire decine di volte. Problemi con fornitori, banche, soci. Per anni non sapeva se sarebbe arrivato al mese dopo.

E la cosa che mi è rimasta impressa è questa: sapere che persone che oggi sono arrivate a quel livello hanno vissuto difficoltà similissime a quelle che tu stai vivendo in quel momento ti permette di prendere un bel respiro e dire ok, se le cose devono succedere, bisogna passare da qui.

È la prima volta che costruiamo un team. E per quanto possa sembrare una cosa lineare da fuori, da dentro è una delle sfide più complesse che abbiamo affrontato: riuscire a creare complementarità tra le hard e le soft skill di persone che hanno storie, ritmi e teste completamente diverse tra loro. 
Ogni nuovo ingresso cambia gli equilibri e ogni volta devi capire come far funzionare l'insieme, non solo le singole parti.

Detto questo, non potremmo essere più contenti del team che stiamo costruendo. Tutte personalità con ambizione e caratteristiche proprie, ognuno porta qualcosa che prima non c'era.

La cosa che ci portiamo dietro da queste prime settimane è che ognuna di queste persone ci ha scelto. Ha guardato una startup di 5 persone, con tutto il caos e l'incertezza che comporta e ha detto sì. Alcune hanno lasciato posti più sicuri. Altre hanno scommesso su di noi quando ancora non avevamo molto da mostrare se non la direzione. 
Questo ci pesa addosso nel senso buono del termine, perché vuol dire che adesso tocca a noi non sprecare quella fiducia.

Le aziende si creano a partire dalle persone, non il contrario. Noi questo lo sentiamo ogni giorno.

La settimana scorsa eravamo tutti in Marocco per il nostro primo offsite. Per noi gli offsite sono lo strumento che ci unisce, che ci fa vedere per quello che siamo al di là dell'orario lavorativo, al di là dell'ufficio, al di là dei ruoli.

Eppure se guardi dove vanno i soldi dei VC nell'HR tech, l'1% finisce su quel segmento.

Otto persone su dieci.

Un centesimo degli investimenti.

Quando abbiamo iniziato a parlare con aziende che assumono cuochi, camerieri, magazzinieri, ci dicevano tutti la stessa cosa: ""Riceviamo centinaia di candidati e gestiamo tutto a mano."" Gli ATS sul mercato erano pensati per chi ha una mail aziendale e un laptop, non per chi lavora su turni e comunica via WhatsApp.

Potevamo inseguire il mercato dei knowledge workers, quello che piace ai VC e finisce sui titoli di TechCrunch.

Abbiamo scelto l'altro.

I numeri iniziano a darci ragione:

↳ Gartner stima che entro il 2025 il 75% delle nuove iniziative mobile sarà diretto ai frontline workers

↳ Il mercato della formazione per deskless workers crescerà da 30 a 64 miliardi di dollari entro il 2030

↳ BCG ha misurato che le aziende che investono in strumenti digitali per questi lavoratori riducono l'assenteismo del 41%

↳ Gli investimenti in HR tech sono cresciuti del 20% YoY nel 2025, con una quota crescente verso il frontline

Quel gap dell'1% non si chiuderà domani. Ma i capitali stanno iniziando a seguire il problema invece di ignorarlo.

""Mettersi nelle condizioni perché gli eventi propizi siano più probabili.“

Esiste una sola tecnica: moltiplicare le occasioni, senza preoccuparsi che molte saranno fallimenti.

A giugno 2023 un investitore si è ritirato all'ultimo da un round da 1 milione. Avevamo già pianificato tutto. Roadmap, assunzioni, il piano per i mesi successivi.

Quella sera ci siamo guardati in faccia e ci siamo chiesti: e adesso?

Abbiamo rifatto tutto da capo. Prodotto nuovo, mercato nuovo.

Era necessario. Ed è stato il motivo per cui siamo arrivati fin qui.

Ora però credo che siamo davanti a uno shift diverso, altrettanto necessario.
Dobbiamo passare da noi che eseguiamo a noi che abilitiamo l'azienda a eseguire.

Execution enabler per me significa spostare il focus:

↳ Dal micro-operativo alla costruzione dei processi
↳ Dalle decisioni implicite alla chiarezza su cosa conta
↳ Dall'intervento continuo alla comunicazione giusta e alle informazioni giuste
↳ Dal ""fare noi"" al mettere le persone nelle condizioni di fare bene, in autonomia

Se l'execution dipende ancora solo dai founder, il sistema non sta funzionando davvero.

L'obiettivo dovrebbe essere che l'execution emerga in modo naturale dal team, perché il contesto è chiaro, le priorità sono condivise, le aspettative sono esplicite.

Questo richiede un cambio di mindset nostro:

↳ Accettare di non essere sempre nel micro
↳ Accettare che nel breve alcune cose possano non essere perfette
↳ Concentrarci sul costruire il sistema che rende l'execution scalabile

Se fai software che tocca i dati delle persone, la compliance va oltre il nice to have. Diventa un vantaggio competitivo.

Specialmente quando sei early stage, tendi a ignorarla: sembra burocrazia, rallenta, costa. Aver investito da subito nella nostra data protection strategy ci ha permesso di chiudere contratti enterprise che altrimenti sarebbero saltati.

Quando si parla di HR il tema è ancora più sensibile. Dati personali, informazioni su candidati e dipendenti, uno dei mercati più esposti ai rischi dell'AI. I clienti enterprise alzano l'asticella prima di firmare e fanno bene.

Per questo abbiamo collaborato con Complaion e concluso il processo di certificazione ISO 27001. Un passo avanti che ci rende più solidi nel mercato enterprise.

Torniamo dal cliente con la certificazione in mano.

Risposta: ""Fantastico. Però nel frattempo abbiamo introdotto una nuova policy. Ora ci serve anche la vostra AI compliance."" 😂

Sei già classificato High Risk secondo l'AI Act.

Il framework europeo mette recruiting e valutazione candidati nella stessa categoria di credit scoring e diagnostica medica.

La settimana scorsa un HR Director mi ha chiesto cosa cambia in pratica per il suo team.

Gli ho fatto tre domande:
↳ Se l'AI scarta un candidato, sai spiegare perché?
↳ C'è qualcuno del tuo team che valida ogni decisione?
↳ Il candidato sa che sta parlando con un'AI?
Ha risposto no a due su tre.

Il punto è che molte aziende hanno già strumenti compliant, ma li usano senza documentare nulla, senza audit trail, senza trasparenza verso i candidati.

E quando arriveranno i controlli, ""non sapevamo"" non sarà una risposta accettabile.

Per anni ho sentito dire: ""Quando sei in fase 0 to 1, testa bassa. Non perdere tempo sui social.""

L'ho fatto anche io per un po'.

Poi ho cambiato idea.

Da quando abbiamo preso sul serio questa cosa, l'impatto è stato immediato:
↳ Brand awareness: le persone sanno chi siamo e cosa stiamo costruendo
↳ Talent attraction: la prima cosa che fa un potenziale hire è leggere i contenuti dei founder, capire la visione, costruirsi una propria narrativa e vedere se c'è allineamento
↳ Thought leadership: le persone ti seguono se hai qualcosa da dire. E da founder è obbligatorio avere qualcosa da dire.

In pochi mesi abbiamo superato 1 milione di impressions.

Le conversazioni che ho avviato, il supporto che sto ricevendo dall'ecosistema, non me lo aspettavo.

Per ora mi sto concentrando su tre cose:
↳ Condividere apertamente risultati ma anche problemi aperti di Klaaryo
↳ La mia visione sui segnali che vedo nel mondo HR e tech
↳ Il nostro percorso come team

La richiesta arriva spesso accompagnata da una domanda prematura: ""Qual è il ROI previsto sulla mia azienda?"".

È ovvio che in questa fase non saprai mai qual è il ritorno sull'investimento. Finché non la provi, è impossibile.

Se fossi dall'altra parte (buyer), cercherei di strutturarmi diversamente per accogliere le novità:

- Budget dedicati alla sperimentazione: fondi allocati con logiche diverse, pensati per muoversi rapidamente senza attendere i cicli di approvazione annuali.
- Co-costruire metriche di impatto: costruire insieme al fornitore gli strumenti che misurino l'efficienza tecnica o l'adozione utente durante il test, invece di proiezioni finanziarie ipotetiche.
- Deroghe al procurement: procedure semplificate (fast-track) per fornitori sotto una certa soglia di spesa o anzianità, evitando di soffocare società costituite da meno di 12 mesi con i requisiti di compliance di una multinazionale.

Alla fine le procedure esistono per proteggere l'azienda, ma a volte fanno il contrario: la isolano dalle opportunità.

Per 18 mesi ho costruito nella direzione sbagliata.

E la cosa assurda è che all'epoca sembrava andasse tutto bene.

Anzi, meglio del bene: utenti in crescita, gente che parlava di noi, qualche articolo qua e là.

Con Zwap stavamo cavalcando tutta questa ondata del remote work post-Covid. L'idea sembrava ovvia: connettere professionisti, freelancer, aziende. Tutti cercavano flessibilità, networking, opportunità.

Solo che poi, quando è arrivato il momento di monetizzare...

Nessuno voleva pagare.

Non perché il prodotto facesse schifo. Ma perché, a conti fatti, non risolvevamo un problema per cui la gente era disposta a tirar fuori i soldi.

Stavamo costruendo qualcosa che piaceva. Ma che, evidentemente, non serviva abbastanza.

E questo, secondo me, è il tranello peggiore quando sei agli inizi: vedere i numeri salire e pensare ""ok, siamo sulla strada giusta"". Quando magari stai solo raccogliendo applausi, non clienti paganti.

A un certo punto abbiamo dovuto fermarci e farci una domanda molto scomoda:

""Ma questo problema qui... è urgente? È frequente? Vale abbastanza da giustificare un'azienda?""

E la risposta, per quanto facesse male, era no.

Oggi con Klaaryo quella domanda ce la facciamo continuamente.

Prima di aggiungere una feature, prima di promettere qualcosa a un cliente, prima anche solo di scrivere codice.

Perché ho capito (a mie spese) che devi costruire la cosa giusta, non solo costruirla bene.

E che a volte il vero coraggio è fermarsi, guardare in faccia la realtà, e ripartire da zero. Anche quando tutto sembra andare bene sulla carta.

Dopo la mappa delle scale-up milanesi, in tanti mi hanno chiesto: ""E Roma?"".

Bella domanda. Ho provato a rispondere, dato che con Klaaryo stiamo aprendo la sede tech proprio lì.

Ho passato qualche ora a cercare startup romane VC-backed, fondate recentemente e ancora attive.

Reperire le informazioni è stato più difficile che a Milano, ma alla fine sono spuntate fuori 10 belle storie: AI, biotech, fintech, cleantech, deeptech.

Più varietà di quanto si racconti.

La mappa la trovate qui sotto.

Sicuramente ne mancano, come dicevo a Roma l'informazione è più frammentata e l'ecosistema meno compatto.
Sono sicuro, però, che insieme riusciremo a trovare tutte quelle realtà che lavorano in silenzio.

Per questo vi chiedo aiuto: aiutatemi a completare il quadro 🙏

Perché un ecosistema diventa più forte quando è connesso e visibile.

↳ Un founder che cerca co-founder può trovare il match giusto

↳ Un investitore che cerca deal flow scopre nuove opportunità prima degli altri

↳ Un talento che cerca la prossima sfida vede tutto il panorama possibile

↳ Un partner che cerca collaborazioni trova chi sta costruendo nella sua stessa direzione

Eppure per anni abbiamo filtrato le persone in base a quello.

""Manca una keyword.""

""Il formato è strano.""

""Ha scritto le date sbagliate""

Scrivo questo post dopo aver guardato i dati di una selezione della settimana scorsa: 147 candidature per un nostro cliente nella ristorazione. Di queste, forse 15 avevano un CV pulito e professionale.

La cosa interessante però è che alcuni dei candidati con i CV peggiori si sono rivelati ottimi candidati dopo la conversazione su WhatsApp.

Infatti da una semplice conversazione emergono cose che un CV non può mostrare: come ragionano, come reagiscono a una domanda inaspettata, che energia hanno.

Con Klaaryo abbiamo deciso di partire proprio da lì, dalla conversazione (su WhatsApp).

Il candidato si racconta, spiega il suo contesto, risponde a domande concrete. E noi non ci limitiamo a raccogliere risposte: interpretiamo come comunica, cosa lo motiva, se c'è fit con il ruolo e con l'azienda.

E la cosa che mi entusiasma di più è che questo approccio non si ferma all'assunzione. La stessa conversazione che usiamo per selezionare può accompagnare la persona nell'onboarding, raccogliere feedback nei primi mesi, capire come sta andando.

Ma: ""Parliamo dal primo giorno e continuiamo lungo tutto il percorso.""

Secondo Gartner, un recruiter spende il 60% del tempo in task operativi: sourcing, screening, follow-up, reminder.

E io continuo a chiedermi: quando automatizzi tutto questo, cosa resta da fare?

Perché la risposta ovvia sarebbe ""meno lavoro.""

Ma parlando con chi lo fa davvero, ho capito che è diverso: non è che hai meno da fare, è che fai cose diverse.

Invece di processare volumi, interpreti i dati; invece di chiamare 50 persone, decidi su quali investire tempo… e così via.

Un'AI conversazionale su WhatsApp può fare pre-screening 24/7, ma può anche fare qualcosa che un CV non può: ovvero leggere come una persona risponde, non solo cosa risponde.

- Il tono.
- La velocità.
- Il modo in cui reagisce a una domanda difficile.

Individua soft skills, motivazioni, valori nascosti tra le righe. Tutte quelle cose che ti aiutano a capire chi hai davanti prima ancora di vederlo.

E questo è interessante perché non si ferma al colloquio.

Se quell'AI ha già parlato con la persona durante il recruiting, può continuare nell'onboarding.

Rispondere a dubbi nei primi giorni. Raccogliere feedback. Guidare.

E nel tempo, costruire una comprensione continua di quella persona: come comunica, cosa la motiva, dove può crescere.

Non più: ""Ti assumo, ti butto dentro, vediamo se sopravvivi.""

Ma: ""Parliamo dal primo giorno e continuiamo lungo tutto il percorso.""

Con Klaaryo stiamo costruendo una piattaforma di conversational intelligence che accompagna le persone su WhatsApp dall'inizio alla crescita: recruiting, onboarding, engagement, sviluppo.

Freetrade was an early adopter of Adclear, working with us on financial promotions and marketing approvals long before this became a formal partnership. So on a personal level, it’s a huge pleasure to now make it official.

What I’ve always respected about Freetrade is how seriously they take creative ambition and responsibility. They push boundaries, move fast, and aren’t afraid to stand out, but they’re just as focused on making sure their messaging is safe, clear and compliant. That balance is hard to get right, and they do it exceptionally well.

As of writing this, they’re also the UK’s only free ISA and free SIPP provider that lets people invest in stocks, ETFs, funds, bonds and more – all while keeping things simple and accessible.

Supporting a team that’s scaling bold marketing without compromising on trust is exactly why we built Adclear in the first place.

Before I get into this (and yes, probably biased), I want to caveat that I don’t think there’s a ""right"" answer here.

It’s never been easier to build internally. At Adclear, if it’s something we’re specialists in, we’ll build it ourselves.

BUT, AI tools are never fixed in place. Keeping them maintained and production-ready over time is hard enough on its own. And it’s not even just the AI, it’s everything around it.

You’re building something that needs to be configurable and adaptable without turning into a mess. In our case, something that marketers actually enjoy using, but that product, design AND compliance also feel comfortable with. On top of that, it has to be enterprise-level auditable, secure, reliable — and still sleek.

That depth is where things get hard, and it’s where most internal builds start to struggle. How much resource do you really want to put into all of that for something that’s ultimately worse than what’s already out there? I recently spoke with the CEO of one of the biggest crypto players in the world who said the same thing.

Why would we try and build our own Granola or Attio?

We’re seeing the same thing across loads of organisations. Teams decide to build their own internal marketing compliance tool because it seems easy at the time, but they always come back. And they’re usually our most active users. Maybe it’s just appreciation for how difficult this actually is after they’ve tried (and not quite done it successfully).

So… do what you think is best for your organisation and don’t necessarily listen to someone on LinkedIn (e.g., me). But if your company isn’t specialising in something, and unless what you’re trying to build is SUPER simple, it might be better buying.","Doni Hoti","activity","urn:li:share:7421534859166306304","2025-11-22","Valid 7421534859933831169","ACoAAC6rCPwBpZdPVsRFkFscsd93uFy9w9v6kWQ","ACwAAC6r","ACwAAC6rCPwB_sPz2GFaDlwojTfmJggDv-KUeUk","ACwAAC6r","✅ Record Found","true",,false

We spent time talking about a shift in fintech that I think is going unnoticed: the rise of the #ComplianceEngineer.
We all know that manual review for financial promos is becoming impossible to manage. The best fintech marketers are testing lots of content variants, and AI is making content creation much easier​. But as content volume goes up, the current ​compliance system breaks.
That’s why I’m so excited about what Adclear is doing—and why I invested in them. They are shifting the paradigm from manual reviews to compliance as infrastructure.
By using AI to enforce policy automatically, they aren't replacing compliance teams; they are freeing them up to focus on high-level strategy and complex risk.​ Defining the policies, not enforcing them. It is helping them ""engineer"" compliance. 
It feels like the inevitable next step for the industry.

Adclear has always been built to be tailored to a firm’s permissions, risk appetite and internal interpretation of the rules. That works well when you’re dealing with one organisation and one compliance team.

Principal firms and BaaS providers change the dynamic.

You’re no longer working with a single interpretation of “acceptable”. You’re working with many - across authorised representatives, business models and use cases - all sitting under the same regulatory umbrella.

The challenge isn’t choosing the right interpretation. It’s building a system that can accommodate that ongoing discourse, without collapsing into inconsistency or endless exceptions.

In practice, marketing compliance at principal-firm level is less about tailoring every decision, and more about capturing those learnings and turning them into something durable. And this isn’t just limited to them, these learnings have helped push Adclear to continue to lead the way in the space.","Doni Hoti","activity","urn:li:share:7420398362618642432","2025-11-22","Valid 7420412500497604609","ACoAAC6rCPwBpZdPVsRFkFscsd93uFy9w9v6kWQ","ACwAAC6r","ACwAAC6rCPwB_sPz2GFaDlwojTfmJggDv-KUeUk","ACwAAC6r","✅ Record Found","true",,false

On y voit comment la Chine, un pays longtemps perçu comme fabricant à bas coût est devenu un acteur majeur de l’innovation, capable non seulement de produire mais de créer et d’exporter des technologies de pointe.

Ce qui m’a le plus marqué, ce n’est pas seulement la vitesse de cette transformation, mais la capacité d’exécution et la cohérence stratégique derrière elle. La Chine ne se contente plus d’adopter des technologies existantes ou de les copier: elle les invente, les adapte et les déploie à grande échelle.  

En Europe et en France, nous devons regarder d’un œil attentif ce qui se joue : investissements publics/privés, formation de talents, standardisation technologique et souveraineté numérique. 

Sommes-nous suffisamment ambitieux et structurés pour réagir et nous inspirer de ce modèle là où c’est pertinent ? 

Il faut parfois savoir regarder le monde comme il est et pas comme on aimerait qu’il soit. 

Bravo pour le documentaire en tout cas 🙌","Alexandre Coudé 🤖","activity","urn:li:share:7420851561540587520","2025-11-22","Valid 7420851562463248384","ACoAAAnZYNMBRRnyCCYY02kcQzHGVjJYQ1Cx_Ng","ACwAAAnZ","ACwAAAnZYNMB62uMDhUAsm2ZY5eTgrhOrtH4gwA","ACwAAAnZ","✅ Record Found","true",,false
,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7420102646734159872","Yes","Shopify x ChatGPT (OpenAI) : À partir de dimanche, les marchands Shopify pourront vendre directement via ChatGPT, sans que le client ne visite leur site.

Le prix ? 
→ Une commission de 4% par vente.

Ce qu'il faut retenir :
→ Le checkout sera activé par défaut (à désactiver manuellement si vous refusez) 
→ Vos produits resteront visibles dans ChatGPT même si vous désactivez le paiement 
%→ OpenAI est le seul acteur à facturer ce service (Google et Microsoft ne prélèvent rien pour l'instant)

La question stratégique : 
4% peut sembler raisonnable comparé aux 8-15% d'Amazon. Mais OpenAI ne gère ni stock, ni logistique, ni SAV. Il capte uniquement la transaction via l'interface conversationnelle.

Pour les e-commerçants, c'est une nouvelle couche de frais qui s'ajoute aux coûts de paiement, marketplace et acquisition déjà existants.

Mon avis : Ce n'est pas qu'une évolution technique, c'est un précédent qui redéfinit la chaîne de valeur du e-commerce. L'IA ne se contente plus de recommander, elle intermédiatise la vente.

Les marchands devront trancher : accepter cette commission pour accéder à un nouveau canal, ou préserver leurs marges au risque de perdre en visibilité.

NielsenIQ / GfK - An NIQ Company qui présentera en février une étude approfondie des résultats des ventes bricolage et jardin en France, révèle dès aujourd'hui un premier bilan des ventes 2025: 
- L'univers du bricolage a encore souffert en 2025 avec un recul de 3,2 % pour un chiffre d'affaires estimé à 24,2 milliards d'euros
- L'univers jardin recule de 1,1 % à 8,3 milliard d'euros. 

Le bricolage qui s'écroulait de -6,4% ralentit sa chute. Le jardin qui perdait -4,8% frôle désormais l'équilibre.

Autre signal intéressant : l'étude intègre maintenant les marketplaces et les hard discounters (Lidl & co), reflétant mieux les nouveaux parcours d'achat.

Et vous, observez-vous les mêmes signaux sur vos secteurs d'activités ?

Il ne rate aucun événement, échange avec la plupart des décideurs e-commerce et est ultra-connecté aux agences comme la nôtre.

L’inviter sur Club Croissance était donc une évidence, un objectif.

On a parlé de Payplug et d’un sujet clé : le paiement.
Le dernier mètre du funnel. Celui où tout peut basculer.

La promesse de Payplug est simple : sécuriser la conversion avec une expérience fluide, des moyens de paiement complets (dont le fractionné) et un 3D Secure intelligent.

J’en ai aussi profité pour lui demander quelles apps Shopify il installerait s’il lançait une marque.

Il en a cité 3, toutes françaises :

Dialog pour lever les dernières objections sur la fiche produit

Crisp IM pour centraliser le service client

Webyn pour analyser finement les parcours utilisateurs et les optimiser

Un échange passionnant avec quelqu’un de vraiment engagé dans l’écosystème.

- Trop de menus
- Trop de catégories
- Trop de clics. 

On ne sait même pas par où commencer.

C'était exactement le problème que nous avons identifié chez 1001 Hobbies, e-commerçant spécialisé en maquettes, figurines et produits dérivés, le paradis des cadeaux de Noël pour les passionnés. (150 000 références). 

Des milliers de cadeaux potentiels. Mais un menu tellement chargé que les visiteurs repartaient bredouilles avant même d'avoir exploré le site.

En période de fêtes, chaque seconde compte. Les gens veulent trouver rapidement, comparer, acheter. Pas se perdre dans un labyrinthe de sous-catégories.

La solution testée ?
Simplifier le menu principal et ajouter un simple bouton ""Tous les produits"" pour garder l'accès complet au catalogue sans la surcharge visuelle.

Le résultat de l'A/B test : +46% de conversions.

Imaginez : presque 1 visiteur sur 2 en plus qui trouve son cadeau et passe à l'achat.

La leçon ? 
En haute saison, la simplicité est votre meilleur allié commercial. Votre site n'a pas besoin de tout montrer. Il doit permettre de trouver vite et bien.

Et vous, votre site est-il prêt pour le rush de Noël ?

Encore une belle édition où l’IA était présente sur la quasi-totalité des stands.

 On sent clairement que nous sommes dans une phase où tout s’accélère :
 ✅ Des process et outils performants il y a encore quelques mois/années deviennent déjà parfois obsolètes et qui se renouvellent.
 ✅ De nouveaux acteurs émergents
 ✅ De nouveaux modes de fonctionnement s’imposent dans le quotidien des équipes retail & e-commerce

Plus que jamais, il va falloir :
- Tester vite
- Mesurer concrètement l’impact business
- et accepter de faire évoluer ses habitudes en continu.

You are, right? You bought the hardware. You secured the location. You connected to the grid. You pay the energy bills every month.

But here's what you don't own: 

1 - You don't decide what drivers pay. Resellers set that price - while adding their own margins on top.

2 - You don't see your customers. 80-90% of sessions come through reseller apps. You get a settlement report with transaction volumes but no customer data.

3 - You don't control when you get paid. Revenue sits with resellers for 30-60 days while you're covering real-time costs and are exposed to credit risk.

So what exactly do you own?

The infrastructure. The risk. The expenses.

Every operator I talk to knows this. And they're quietly furious about it.

But most have convinced themselves this is just how EV charging works. That you need resellers to reach drivers, that giving up control is the price of distribution.

It's not.

We built Cariqa because we believe operators deserve to own what they have built.

A platform model where operators and drivers transact directly. No resellers extracting value.

You set the price. You see every customer. You get instant settlement and keep the margin.","Tamara Ciullo","activity","urn:li:share:7430212976030150656","2025-11-22","Valid 7430212978966372352","ACoAACA9kikBrUHKOdvFbSJeNcRXEHXdjksnoUs","ACwAACA9","ACwAACA9kikBean3BgHg90saJUA7A13_gkZ27Eg","ACwAACA9","✅ Record Found","true",,false

2.45× ad-hoc energy sold.

This is exactly why we built Cariqa Go.
Ad-hoc charging is often treated as a compliance checkbox, something you “have to” offer.

But when operators have real control over pricing, settlement and brand experience? It becomes a serious commercial lever.

With enercity, this wasn’t about swapping one QR page for another. It was about putting control back where it belongs, giving them:

→Backend-agnostic deployment
→Granular tariff and fee configuration
→Station and connector-level pricing
→Multiple payment methods
→Direct settlement
→Full brand visibility, from checkout to invoice

enercity rolled out Cariqa Go across their network and ran a like-for-like comparison against their previous QR solution, normalised for 27% network growth.

The outcome?
Ad-hoc charging revenue and energy sold more than doubled.

When you treat ad-hoc charging as a strategic channel - not an afterthought - performance follows.

Huge thanks to Constantin Reese, Annkathrin Scheck, Luca Diem and the entire enercity team for the collaboration and trust. Working with operators who know exactly what they want commercially makes all the difference.

Same charger. Same kWh. Four wildly different prices, none of them set by him.

This is the EV charging industry in 2026.

Operators build the infrastructure, pay the energy costs, take on the risk and then watch resellers add their own markups and control what drivers actually pay.

The result is pricing that's completely distorted, leaving drivers navigating a puzzle of apps and hidden fees, with no idea who to trust.

We built Cariqa because we believe that a platform model will be better for everyone.

Operators and drivers interact directly, which means that operators can:

Control their own prices
Enjoy instant settlements
Have a direct sales channel with customers and total visibility of their behaviour
Boost station utilisation with dynamic pricing

While drivers get the transparent, direct, operator-set pricing, however they choose to pay.

The operators who took on the risk and built the infrastructure deserve to run the business. Not watch from the sidelines while resellers extract value.

That's what we're fixing.

Back then, every single conversation began with explaining why the market doesn’t work the way it should. Why CPOs lose control. Why drivers pay marked-up prices. Why it’s all unnecessarily complicated.

I remember Power2Drive 2024. Our product wasn’t even fully out yet. The concept was solid, and once people sat down with us, they saw the point.
Now something has shifted.
With recent additions like TEAG, CITYWATT and daemobil, CPOs are starting to say:
“Hang on… maybe those guys are onto something.”

Maybe there is a better way.

People are coming to us now because they’re looking for a real alternative. One that puts the CPO back in control. One where EV drivers buy energy directly from the source. No detours. No distractions.
It’s actually a simple idea.

My focus is now shifting to the demand partners of Cariqa:
With Cariqa Connect, we’re making offering charging as simple as the click of a button. (To all engineers - I know I am trivialising lol) 

Yes, charging APIs have existed for years.
But have you seen the prices? Heavily marked up.
We don’t do that.

Platforms integrating Cariqa Connect get the ACTUAL prices set by the CPOs on our platform. Direct. Transparent.

I’ll probably be banging on about this quite a bit in the coming weeks… so bear with me.

Also, a big shout-out to the two incredible people who just joined the team: Denise Feierabend and Luca Degen. Both bringing industry experience from completely different angles.

Very lucky to have them on board.

With Cariqa Retail Rewards, now live as a pilot, we’re actively unlocking that value by connecting charging with nearby retail spend, together with PFALZWERKE AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT and Decathlon. 

The offer is simple: spend €50 at Decathlon and get €10 off your charging session instantly.

What makes this truly powerful is how easy it is to roll out. There’s zero integration required with existing systems, and EV drivers can start charging however they choose:

➡️ ad hoc via QR code at the station
➡️ via the Cariqa app
➡️ or, if retailers want, directly inside their own app, enabling users to start charging from there

For CPOs, this unlocks new value at existing locations without adding operational complexity.
For retailers, it creates a direct and measurable way to engage nearby customers.
For EV drivers, it means a better charging experience with instant savings applied in real time.

With collaborations like these, charging becomes more than just energy... it becomes part of a connected ecosystem where everyone benefits.
Grounded in real-world use cases rather than theory, this is exactly what the EV space needs to move forward.

New resolutions. 
I was just writing mine for 2026.

Somewhere between “drink more water” and “less screen time”, I realised I got distracted. And while “get less distracted” was also on the list, this one felt worth it.

I thought, what if the EV charging industry were a person with aspirations? 
I’m pretty sure the EV charging industries New Year resolutions would look something like this:

- Accept that I’m no longer a small hobby and start acting accordingly
- Clean up my circle and keep only relationships that actually add value to key players in the market 
- Make pricing so simple EV drivers don’t need a PhD to understand it
- Stop giving the same person five apps, three cards and 100 different prices
- Be interesting enough that people still talk about me when AI is in the room
- Stop getting beaten down by whatever decisions are made in politics. The tide has already turned, nothing can stop me...

This year has been a big one for Cariqa.

We secured a €4M investment from incredible investors and welcomed amazing new CPOs. Just to name a few da emobil, CITYWATT GmbH, enercity and many more. Seeing more and more CPOs trust us and build with us has been incredibly motivating.

We also grew the team, and that’s probably what I’m most grateful for. I get to work with smart, driven people, we learn from each other every day, and we build something together that truly matters.

I’m especially thankful for Issam Tidjani, Stefano Bonetta and Mario La Pergola. We’re very different people, but we complement each other in the best possible way. Fully focused, and maybe just a little obsessed with rewriting the EV charging market.

🛒 L’e-commerce “non avrebbe mai sostituito il negozio”.

L’AI nel recruiting non sostituisce l’umano. Elimina l’attrito. E lascia alle persone il momento in cui essere davvero umane.

È la carenza di organizzazioni pronte al futuro.

L’articolo di Forbes sull’evoluzione dall’HR tradizionale all’Agentic Organization mette a fuoco un punto cruciale: inserire l’AI nei processi non basta.

Il vero salto competitivo è un altro.

Ripensare l’impresa come un ecosistema in cui persone e agenti intelligenti collaborano, con responsabilità distribuita, nuove logiche decisionali e una governance chiara.

Non è una trasformazione tecnologica.
È una trasformazione culturale e di leadership.

Negli ultimi anni ho visto molte aziende investire in strumenti.
Molte meno investire nel ridisegno del modello organizzativo.
E senza quel ridisegno, l’AI resta un acceleratore scollegato dalla strategia.
Potenzia l’esistente, ma non genera vero vantaggio competitivo.

È anche per questo che ho scelto di entrare in Klaaryo come Partner.
Perché sono convinta che nei prossimi anni non vincerà chi “ha l’AI”,
ma chi saprà progettare organizzazioni capaci di integrarla in modo consapevole, etico e strategico.

La vera sfida non è adottare tecnologia. È governarla.

In Klaaryo lavoriamo esattamente su questo: trasformazione reale, governance dell’innovazione, evoluzione dei modelli organizzativi.
Non hype. Architettura.

Il 2026 non premierà le aziende che adottano più tecnologia. Premierà quelle che sapranno ripensare sé stesse prima degli altri.

La domanda non è se cambiare.
È con quale visione e con quale velocità scegliamo di farlo.

Il retreat del team Klaaryo in #Marocco è stata una di quelle.

Una settimana condivisa tra il team di Milano e il team di Roma, fatta di lavoro, #roleplay, #empatia, #ascolto e #gioco. Una settimana in cui abbiamo costruito – davvero – uno spirito di squadra forte, vivo, presente.

Abbiamo lavorato insieme, certo.
Ma abbiamo anche fatto #surf, #yoga, #sandboarding.
Abbiamo ballato, cantato, riso.
Abbiamo condiviso tempo e spazio con la popolazione marocchina, con persone che ci hanno trasmesso energia, voglia di fare, voglia di mettersi in gioco.
Abbiamo incontrato la campionessa marocchina di #bodyboarding, oggi anche filmmaker, che ci ha mostrato un cortometraggio sull’emancipazione femminile: donne che oggi possono fare surf, con madri che sono coach. Storie che parlano di #futuro, di #possibilità, di #cambiamentoreale.
Abbiamo osservato un Paese che sta costruendo tanto, con poco.

Su suggerimento di Viola di Claudio, grande professionista e voce preziosa, ci siamo fermati a riflettere su una domanda semplice ma potentissima:
 👉 com’è la nostra valigia al rientro?
La risposta è arrivata chiara.

È piena di cose importanti:
#ritmo
#gratitudine
#spensieratezza
#consapevolezza
#fiduciaCheSiAllena
#energia
#connessioniReali
#coraggio
#empatiaInAzione
#crescereInsieme

Abbiamo capito che i team più forti non sono quelli che vanno alla stessa velocità, ma quelli che vivono, giocano e combattono insieme, anche nelle differenze.
E che la vera sfida è continuare a ballare tutti sulla stessa musica, anche quando la musica cambia.

Per me, per noi, ci sarà un prima e un dopo questo retreat.

A livello personale, torno a casa con una scoperta in più: una nuova passione per il #surf.
E soprattutto con una frase che il nostro maestro mi ha detto e che porterò con me.
Nel surf – come nella vita e nel lavoro – le onde non si dominano con la forza.
Si osservano, si capiscono, si rispettano.
E poi si impara ad adattarsi, a cambiare movimento, postura, ritmo, in base all’onda che arriva.

Un ringraziamento speciale va a Luca Tamborino Frisari, che ha reso possibile tutto questo con una cura enorme e tanta dedizione: si è visto in ogni dettaglio ed in ogni momento.
E GRAZIE a tutto il team Klaaryo, per la voglia autentica di esserci, di mettersi in gioco e di fare davvero la differenza insieme. 💛

Saturiamo feed e testa di contenuti veloci, “facili”, che confondono la mente e appiattiscono lo sguardo. Poi ci stupiamo se perdiamo profondità, prospettiva e capacità di leggere i segnali.

E questo è uno di quei segnali che meritano spazio.

Per la prima volta, ai #GlobeSoccerDWCLLC di #Dubai, è stata introdotta una categoria dedicata al #mentalcoaching.
E a vincerla è stata Nicoletta Romanazzi.

Certamente non si tratta “solo” di un premio.
Concordo assolutamente con Nicoletta quando dice che è un messaggio culturale: il riconoscimento del lavoro invisibile sulla mente, sulla preparazione interiore, sulla presenza.

Nel mio lavoro lo vedo ogni giorno: senza un assetto valoriale chiaro e senza la capacità di #ascoltare davvero le persone, non c’è strategia, innovazione o performance che tenga.
Il risultato arriva solo quando c’è qualità del pensiero, della relazione e dell’ascolto.

In un mondo ancora ossessionato da ciò che è visibile, misurabile, ma sopratutto immediato, questo premio ci ricorda che la differenza spesso nasce altrove.
In ciò che scegliamo di coltivare, anche quando non fa rumore.

Complimenti davvero Nicoletta Romanazzi!

Ho avuto il privilegio di moderare - insieme a Giovanni De Cesare - una giornata che ha superato ogni aspettativa: una location straordinaria, contenuti potenti, speaker che hanno portato visione e concretezza, tavoli tematici capaci di trasformare il dibattito in azione.

Quando Manuele Vailati mi ha proposto la conduzione, ho sentito tutta la responsabilità… ma anche l’onore.
Perché guidare una conversazione sull’innovazione significa affrontare i nodi veri: #competenze, #culture, #persone, #tecnologia.

I tavoli tematici hanno toccato le sfide più urgenti del nostro ecosistema:
 👉 #competenze e #formazione
 👉 #cybersecurity
 👉 #sostenibilità
 👉 #leadership e #culturaorganizzativa
 👉 #DB&I
 👉 #AItransformation

🎤 Grazie uno ad uno agli speaker, per i contenuti, la profondità e la generosità intellettuale: erino colombi, @antoniocarcaterra, Alessio Gerbaldi Davide Polotto, Eleonora Marino, Gianfranco De Simone, Marco Pagano, Daniele Regolo, Agata Matarazzo, Paolo Ponzio.
Grazie a tutti coloro che hanno preso parte ai tavoli, trasformando il confronto in direzione.
Un grazie speciale a Manuele Vailati, per la fiducia e per aver creato un #ecosistema dove innovazione, persone e coraggio convivono davvero e a Virginia Vignati Antonio Peruzzi per il supporto ed il coordinamento.

Il Summit è stato questo: una giornata intensa, ricca, costruita con professionisti, docenti, leader e amici che sanno dove stanno andando e soprattutto perché.
Persone che credono in un futuro al servizio delle idee, delle imprese e della comunità.
Di una cosa sono certa: quando ci si muove con i #valori giusti, si può andare molto lontano.

Grazie a tutti.
A presto ✨","Luana Terrile","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7401236646534295553","2025-11-22","Valid 7401236646534295553","ACoAABKC34IBL5x7P2QIwEzVTdUj70lft9nGjU8","ACwAABKC","ACwAABKC34IBxS98OStBHDYVkHbEG9duO7RpOF8","ACwAABKC","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Il Covid ha ribaltato le regole del gioco, in Italia sono cambiati i driver motivazionali, la #retention è diventata IL tema, il #mismatch domanda–offerta continua a crescere, le #competenze scarseggiano, la #demografia non è dalla nostra parte, l’ingaggio della #GenZ sfida ogni modello precedente.
E, sopra tutto questo, si è ""aggiunta"" la #AI transformation. What else?

Ecco perché momenti come questo diventano vitali: perché ci permettono di condividere #pratiche, #successi, #fallimenti, #idee… ma soprattutto lo spirito che guida le nostre azioni e la nostra voglia di costruire valore.
Per le persone.
Per le organizzazioni.
E, in fondo, anche per noi stessi.

Sono grata per le giornate trascorse all’insegna del #movimento, delle #conversazioni e di un confronto autentico che fa bene al settore e a chi lo anima ogni giorno.

Grazie a tutti voi per l’energia, la trasparenza e l’ispirazione che portate.

Avanti così, insieme 💛✨

È un atto di verità.

Racconta cosa sei diventato dopo scelte difficili, iterazioni infinite, qualche scivolone e tanti momenti in cui sarebbe stato più semplice fermarsi (forse!).

Il lavoro fatto sintetizza esattamente questo:
una nuova identità che riflette una nuova solidità, una nuova chiarezza e una nuova ambizione.

Il claim “Conversations that move talents” è il cuore di tutto.
Perché dice, in una frase, ciò che ci muove ogni giorno: mettere le persone al centro di processi che troppo spesso dimenticano l’essenziale - la conversazione, la relazione, la risposta.

È il brand di una scale-up che ha trovato la sua direzione e il suo WHY.

E questo è solo l’inizio 🚀

In emerging markets, stablecoins are moving from a trading tool to the fastest, most efficient way to send and hold digital dollars. For users and fintechs navigating currency volatility and limited access to USD, stablecoins are becoming the new alternative to traditional financial infrastructure.

Here are 3 real-world stablecoin yield use cases OpenTrade powers in emerging markets 👇

✅ Automatic payroll yield
Payroll fintechs can integrate dollar-denominated stablecoin yield directly into their products, helping employees protect income from devaluation and grow savings denominated in a stable currency like the US dollar.

✅ Treasury management
Companies with on-chain treasuries can put idle USDC and USDT balances to work to earn stable, predictable yield while maintaining the liquidity needed for payments and operations.

✅ Embedded USD and EUR-denominated yield products
Fintechs and exchanges offering stablecoin accounts can launch simple and accessible savings products in markets where fiat dollar accounts are difficult to access.

I'm in Dublin next week for a few days - keen to meet up with Engineers who would be down to chat about roles at Solidroad.

Drop me a DM if anything here looks interesting 👀https://lnkd.in/eEm2sid8

Solidroad is scaling fast, we have some great investors and a lot of capital to invest, and most importantly, we're solving thorny problems for some amazing companies (check out our customers on our website to see for yourself).

We're looking for someone who's been around the block to lead our Engineering org in Dublin and build a killer team this side of the Atlantic, along with some hungry and determined folks to work closely with them. If either of these seem like a good fit for you (or you know someone who would be a great fit) please slide into my DMs.

Even if you're not sure, always worth a shot and I promise I'm a fun coffee chat-er 🚀

Sure, product matters. Leadership matters. Earning potential matters. But if you dread showing up on a Monday? It catches up with you fast.


This week our team headed to Silverstone, breathwork, tennis, yoga, sauna, and a brutally cold lake that absolutely nobody was ready for.


The kind of experience that strips away the work personas and reminds you that the people sitting next to you in the office are actually humans you genuinely enjoy spending time with.


When people like who they work with, performance follows. Not because someone told them to hit a number, because they don't want to let each other down.

• Grow revenue, retention and customer love with lab data while saving engineering and medical resources
• Standardise biomarker data from any source (labs, APIs, PDFs, images)
• Power personalisation, longitudinal insights and AI-driven features 
• Prepare for what’s coming next in health data

We’ll also walk through practical examples from companies like Roche, Aware, PERFORMULA, ŌURA and Function Health and more, on how they turn lab data into real value. 

Before joining OpenHealth Technologies, I honestly had no idea lab data fragmentation was even a thing. I was pretty shocked to learn that it’s one of the biggest silent blockers holding AI deployment and personalised health experiences back.

The same biomarker can be measured in different materials, units and reference ranges, even within the same country (especially in Europe and LatAm).

And building that standardisation in-house usually means dedicated medical teams validating biomarker standards plus hundreds of thousands in engineering effort just to map fragmented results. 🫠

Across hundreds of conversations with teams from labs, longevity clinics, insurers, startups and more, one pattern became impossible to ignore: the vision for personalised, AI-powered health is there, but the data foundation is not.

We hope this webinar helps make that gap clearer and more actionable. Please let us know if you have any burning questions or topics you’d like us to cover!

Standardised lab data.

Despite shaping 70 percent of medical decisions and billions of tests run each year, lab data is still unusable for most healthtech and longevity companies.
Across hundreds of conversations with teams from labs, longevity clinics, insurers, startups and more, one pattern became impossible to ignore: the vision for personalised, AI-powered health is there, but the data foundation is not.

Why it is so difficult:
 • The same biomarker can be measured in different materials, units and reference ranges, even inside the same country (especially in Europe and LatAm).
 • Results arrive in every format you can imagine: PDFs, portals, APIs, images.
 • Building standardisation or historical insights in-house means dedicated medical teams validating biomarker standards and months of engineering time mapping fragmented results.

The outcome is always the same: teams spend enormous resources on infrastructure instead of improving products, patient journeys or health outcomes. This is exactly the problem we built OpenHealth Technologies to solve. And next week, we want to share what we have learned supporting leading health organisations worldwide.

🎙️  On 16th December, I am hosting a 60 minute masterclass together with Frederic Muench, MD, and Ivana Istochka: ""Transforming Lab Data into Value with AI""

We will walk through:
 • How to ingest biomarker data from any source at scale
 • Why standardised data unlocks longitudinal insights, personalisation and AI
 • How leading teams grow revenue, retention and customer love while saving engineering and medical resources
 • Practical use cases from Aware, Roche, Oura, Function Health and others
 • What is coming next in health data and AI deployment

Geopolitics, culture, AI, socio-economic shifts, access to information and tools… the world seems to be changing really fast. It’s very clear that we’re living through a big moment.

Two weeks ago at Slush, I’m grateful I got the opportunity to connect with some of the founders, operators and investors shaping these changes (some who are huge inspirations of mine), spend time with friends, and learn. A lot.

A few learnings that really stayed with me:
> No matter what you're working on, speed of learning beats raw talent or unique ideas. Now more than ever.
> The real differentiator is constantly asking your customers ""what is your biggest problem?"" then putting stuff out for them, learning and iterating fast.
> Companies live in non-stationary reality: markets, constraints, and people change constantly. It's expected that your product, culture and story will keep evolving too. Don't fight it. 
> Stay open to a ""yes, and"" world where different, even competing truths coexist. Be careful of adopting someone else's experience as your own.
> Don't copy competitors, you'll converge. Learn from others doing one piece insanely well. Want sticky products in health? Maybe go study gaming.
> If you find something you enjoy doing, surround yourself with people who help you grow, and just show up every day, you can do things your own way and build something meaningful. (Proud to have a lot of this at OpenHealth Technologies)

The theme of the conference was about believing in Europe. I have to say, if Europe wants to matter, we need to create regulations that support innovation instead of blocking it ASAP, make it easier to incorporate and scale, and create smarter taxations and stock option plans (as someone who worked outside Europe most of my life, a lot of these things still shock me).

But I have a belief that we can, and we will.

Grateful for all the conversations with so many incredible people incl. Marco, Anders, Francesca, Khurram, Elina, Stoddy, Carolyn, Sebastian, Dzenis, Samir, Wipawee, Tea, Alina, Veera, Maaike, Steve, Philippe, Johan, Taru, Martin, Till, Reinhard, Christina, Dr. Dennis, Mathias, Otto, Filip, Clare, Lucia, Tymon, Irene (and many more).

That’s how Martin Scholz kicked off our partner training in our offices last week.
No fluff. No sugarcoating.

As we keep growing the Introw team, one thing is non-negotiable:
everyone needs to truly understand how partnerships work

So we brought in Martin Scholz, partnership veteran, to run a full ""Partner Manager Certification Day"".

And here’s the thing 👇
When partnerships are done right, they don’t just generate revenue, they unlock scale:
✅ Shorter sales cycles
✅ Higher win rates
✅ Better-quality leads (hello, PQLs* 👋)

Feeling incredibly bullish about what we’re building at introw.io, and for whom we’re building it.

In his own words, he sums himself up with three emojis:

🦒 My friends call me a giraffe (you’ll see yourself if you meet him in person 😉)

I'm absolutely buzzing with today's launch of Tyro Rules Engine! 🔥

️⚡️Put Tyro to work for you! 
The Rules Engine allows you to set custom triggers for attendance and behaviour, and ultimately digitise your school policies.  Once a threshold is met, Tyro takes over the heavy lifting by automatically sending alerts, in-app messages, SMS, dashboard notifications, logging events, and much more.  

✴️ Tiered Interventions: Set rules to alert Year Heads the moment a student hits 5, 10 or 15 days of absence, ensuring no one slips through.

✴️ Automated Data Collection: Trigger forms to be sent to staff/parents, for example, to collect student reflections related to behaviour or exam results.

✴️ Proactive Attendance Tracking: Automatically send an SMS at 10:00 AM to parents of students with unexplained absences, prompting them to submit a reason directly through the app.

✴️ Compliance Made Easy: Automatically notify the Deputy Principal when a student reaches the 20-day mark, streamlining the mandatory Tusla reporting process.

✴️ Behavioural Support: Trigger a ""Highlight"" on leadership dashboards when a student reaches 10 lates, prompting a parent-teacher meeting before the issue escalates.

This is live now for all schools!  A catalogue of 'best in class' rules is available to customise and switch on immediately, or build your own from scratch.","Patrick Barry","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7419341017708941313","2025-11-22","Valid 7419341017708941313","ACoAAAFhVaUBwctLhBfdqrKpKgSkIh84pzjpm-w","ACwAAAFh","ACwAAAFhVaUB8yNkIyJCd5H0xJV80NtZUDnv3w4","ACwAAAFh","✅ Record Found","false",,false

What we’re NOT happy with: 
 - nothing. I’m okay with this. 

What we’re HAPPY with: 

- ban on bots evens the playing field as vendors used this to short cut the strict rules Xero imposes on those of us building with their full API

- ban on using data for AI/ML training. This is going to knee cap some newer AI companies assuming quick wins without the hard yards to build your own IP and training data. 

Why am I happy? 

We’ve never accessed historical data - just about every accountant knows most clients don’t have perfect, consistent data. That’s a minefield leading to poor AI training anyway. 

We self-annotate every single document - and have done for 15months - with accountants on our payroll. Can you imagine how big and useful that asset is for us :D 

*Investors* in Accounting startups the last 24 months should audit their portfolio ASAP. 

Xero will want to audit some they already suspect, and ban them when/if they refuse. 

This is bad for innovation - as the data belongs to clients not Xero so I do think they’re overstepping a bit, but it proves how hard this problem is to solve. Don’t take shortcuts. 

- Pay for access. I’m okay - I hated the marketplace % fee they forced on us as an Advanced Partner. As long as their API and documentation improves - I won’t complain. 

I know Xero want to make improvements to the API but this needs product & political support internally as they have the technical and BA capability to do this. Cause it’s SUPER sh*te right now.

Wenn die Regale leer sind, verliert der Handel Umsatz.
Wenn sie zu voll sind, verliert er Marge.

Walmart stand genau vor dieser Herausforderung – und hat sie nicht über Bauchgefühl gelöst, sondern durch einen besseren Blick auf die eigenen Daten.
Das Unternehmen hat Verkaufszahlen, regionale Muster, Wetter, Events und Saisonalität zusammengeführt. Dadurch wurde früher erkennbar, wo Nachfrage steigt und wann Produkte nachgesteuert werden müssen.

Das Ergebnis: +22 % Umsatzwachstum im E-Commerce – in nur einem Quartal.

Die eigentliche Erkenntnis dahinter hat für mich wenig mit Technologie zu tun. Entscheidend ist die Fähigkeit, aus den vorhandenen Daten klare Entscheidungen abzuleiten:
-       Was treibt die Nachfrage?
-       Wo entstehen Risiken?
-       Welche Chancen liegen im Bestand?
-       Welche Regionen entwickeln sich anders als geplant?

Solche Beispiele zeigen mir immer wieder, dass es selten an den Daten fehlt. Der Engpass entsteht beim Verstehen. Unternehmen sitzen auf allen relevanten Informationen – aber oft fehlt der entsprechende Zugang zu den Daten, der es ihnen ermöglicht, diese Fragen wirklich zu beantworten.

Und genau hier setzt Scavenger AI an.

Was Walmart mit einem Millionenbudget entwickelt hat, wird mit Scavenger für jedes Unternehmen nutzbar – einfach per natürlicher Sprache und ad hoc:
·      „Welche Produkte drohen mir nächste Woche auszugehen?“
·      „Wo liegt mein totes Kapital in Überbeständen?“
·      „Welche Nachfrage-Trends entstehen gerade in meiner Region?“

So wird aus Daten sofortige Handlung – ohne komplexe BI-Prozesse, ohne Wartezeit.

Wer im Data & Analytics-Umfeld arbeitet, kennt sie alle:

1.	Der Chaos Agent:
stellt ständig Ad-hoc-Fragen, alles ist dringend und alles muss sofort beantwortet werden.

2.	Der Ghost:
meldet sich monatelang nicht und taucht dann plötzlich mit einer brennenden Frage auf, die eigentlich gestern hätte beantwortet werden müssen.

3.	Der Micromanager:
möchte jede Abfrage, jede Tabelle und jede Visualisierung kontrollieren.

4.	Der Champion:
unterstützt Analysten, vermittelt zwischen Teams und treibt Data Culture nach vorne.

Das Problem dabei: Diese Typen entstehen nicht, weil Menschen „schwierig“ sind. Sie entstehen, weil Fachbereiche abhängig von BI-Teams sind. Weil jeder Datenbedarf über einen Flaschenhals läuft.

👉 Mit Scavenger AI drehen wir dieses Muster um.
•	Der Chaos Agent wird zum Power User, der selbst Antworten findet.
•	Der Ghost greift dann auf Daten zu, wenn er sie braucht – ohne Umwege.
•	Der Micromanager baut sich eigene Reports in Sekunden.
•	Und der Champion? Der wird zum echten Evangelisten für Self-Service Analytics.

As a challenge sponsor, we provided participating teams with access to our ONE AI platform.

The challenge: Develop a working computer vision prototype within 24 hours and demonstrate how ONE AI can be used to
- run AI locally on lean devices,
- generate task-specific neural networks,
- and outperform generic AI approaches.

Our next spotlight: SkinGuard – AI-powered initial skin assessment.

The Problem
Millions of people experience uncertainty when facing skin conditions:
- No trustworthy digital first assessment
- Google-driven worst-case anxiety
- Weeks of waiting for dermatology appointments

The team addressed a simple but powerful question: 

Can Vision AI provide a reliable first medical orientation directly on a smartphone?

The Solution: SkinGuard
Within 24 hours, a fully functional prototype was built. 
Users take a photo of the affected skin area. 
A task-specific dermatology model generated with ONE AI analyzes the image.

The system delivers:
- A predicted skin condition
- A clear recommendation (doctor needed or not)
- Over-the-counter treatment suggestions

A customized skin condition model was trained using ONE AI on labeled dermatological images.

What normally requires months of AI development, mobile integration and model optimization was implemented in ONE day.

SkinGuard demonstrates how ONE AI enables medical-grade Vision AI applications to be built rapidly: from dataset to deployable mobile app.

Healthcare is just one of many domains where ONE AI changes what is possible in 24 hours.

As a challenge sponsor, we gave the teams access to our ONE AI platform.

The challenge: Develop a working computer vision prototype in any application domain and demonstrate how ONE AI can be used to
- run AI creatively and locally on lean hardware,
- tailor models precisely to the specific application,
- and thereby outperform classical, generic AI approaches.

Our results series starts with the winning team. They not only solved this challenge, but went on to win the entire hackathon.

The solution: Vision-based Process Mining.
Classic process mining stops where processes are carried out manually. This is exactly where the challenge began: Camera data from real workplaces had to be processed locally, semantically interpreted and automatically transformed into structured event logs. 

Within just 24 hours, a fully functional prototype was created, demonstrating that ONE AI does not merely generate models, but enables an essential part of an industrial AI pipeline at the edge. Video streams are processed in real time directly on edge devices. Objects and human activities are detected and classified using ONE AI models. Process steps (including timestamps) are dynamically extracted and automatically converted into structured event logs.
Training, inference, and event correlation all run entirely locally. Process deviations such as missing steps, incorrect sequences or duplicates are detected automatically and the results can be directly integrated into existing process mining and analytics tools.

What was previously an “invisible” manual process becomes a digital twin of the real workflow.

Vision-based Process Mining is just one of nearly infinitely many possible use cases that can be implemented with ONE AI in a very short time.

This inspired us so much that we decided to integrate this capability directly into ONE AI, making it possible to create a classification dataset from video data extremely quickly (last picture).

Over the course of three days, the winning team developed a Vision AI prototype focused specifically on this problem.

Using our ONE AI Vision Platform, they created a solution that:
- detects people in the scene
- identifies key body regions such as the head and upper body
- checks whether helmets and safety vests are present
- and visually marks situations where required safety equipment is missing

We are incredibly impressed by how quickly and effectively the team built this Vision AI solution with ONE AI. The prototype shows how AI can support organizations in recognizing potential safety risks earlier and increasing worker protection on-site. Even within a super fast development cycle.

And importantly:
This is just one of many possible Vision AI applications that can be built with ONE AI.","Ali Durmaz","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7402011796041003008","2025-11-22","Valid 7402011796041003008","ACoAADZmOsgBjPEowZDbj6CGhYaUdEs_V9B04nY","ACwAADZm","ACwAADZmOsgBiQUO0I6iL7PXvfSQ-TNDVakASlo","ACwAADZm","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Last weekend we co-powered the Road to START Hackathon organized by START Nuremberg at ZOLLHOF – Tech Incubator. A weekend where builders turned Vision AI ideas into real, working prototypes.

The Challenge? Build the coolest Vision AI application with ONE AI. From shaping a concept, preparing a dataset, training a AI model with ONE AI to presenting a prototype that showed real value. 

Our challenge pushed participants to create an end-to-end Vision AI solution in just 48 hours.

Congratulations to Team Gearguard with Julian Pleyer, Muhammed Dursun & Benjamin Werner for taking first place with their smart approach to safety recognition in construction environments.

A big thank you to all teams, the organizing staff, partners and supporters who contributed to an amazing hackathon environment. 

And we’re not slowing down. This weekend we’re taking the same energy to the Hackathon in Munich organized by START Munich, ready to push the limits of Vision AI even further.

Lo creo profundamente.

Cuantos más dealers haya, más competitivo es el mercado.
Y cuanto más competitivo es, mejor para todos:
	•	Mejores precios
	•	Más oferta
	•	Más especialización
	•	Más diferenciación
	•	Más profesionalidad

Un mercado dominado por pocos gigantes no es más fuerte.
Es más frágil.

En Dealcar  trabajamos para que el long tail —pequeños y medianos concesionarios— pueda competir de tú a tú con los grandes grupos.

Y eso no es ir contra nadie.
Es fortalecer el ecosistema.

Porque cuando grandes grupos como Grupo Flexicar  u OcasionPlus empiezan a construir marca propia y a reducir su dependencia de portales, desapareciendo de coches.net por ejemplo , están entrando directamente en el terreno de los marketplaces.

Eso cambia las reglas del juego.

Por eso creemos que es fundamental construir un mercado donde:
	•	Los dealers sean fuertes
	•	Los marketplaces sigan siendo relevantes coches.net  AutoScout24  coches.com & autodescuento.com  Wallapop  
	•	Y el software conecte a todos Dealcar  

Coches.net, AutoScout y Wallapop son piezas fundamentales del sector.
Lo han sido y lo seguirán siendo. Y nosotros luchamos por ello ❤️ (nuestro producto tiene más vale cuanto más valor tienen los portales) estamos súper alineados!

Sí, viene la IA.
Sí, vienen las redes sociales.
Sí, viene Google como canal directo.

Pero la estrategia real del futuro no es sustituir canales.
Es combinarlos 100x mejor.

No es elegir entre portal o marca propia.
Es integrarlo todo.

Portales + software + IA + distribución + marca propia.

Si queremos que nuestros modelos tengan sentido a largo plazo, tenemos que construir juntos un ecosistema más competitivo.

Cuantos más dealers profesionalizados haya, más valor tienen los portales.👀
Cuanto más fácil sea operar para el long tail, más fuerte es el mercado.

Hacer la vida fácil al long tail es lo que genera verdadera defensibilidad.

Y eso es lo que estamos construyendo en Dealcar.

Congrats to Kavak for their new $300M round led by Andreessen Horowitz .

This news hit me in a very personal way.

A few years ago, I lived in #Mexico 🇲🇽
And while I was there, I had the chance to see the used car market up close — messy, fragmented, inefficient… but full of potential.

And then I saw Kavak.

Not just as a company.
But as a thesis.

That experience shaped me deeply — and it’s one of the reasons why I later decided to build Dealcar with Sergio Guisado Villanueva .

⸻

1️⃣ The used car market is #brutal at scale

As the market matures, gross profit per car gets tighter.

Used car retail is structurally a low-margin business.
And it’s a market that will always remain highly fragmented.

Even Kavak — after years of execution — still controls only around ~#2% of the Mexican market.

That tells you everything:
Scaling “car by car” is incredibly hard, capital intensive, and almost impossible to consolidate.

⸻

2️⃣ After the downround, they understood the real game

The game is not only selling cars.
The game is value-added services.

Since then, they doubled down on:
	•	🔹 Efficiency
	•	🔹 Technology
	•	🔹 Fintech

They launched Kuna Capital  to originate loans and capture financial value.
And they launched Kavak Aliados, a platform designed to empower independent dealers — including many of their former competitors — with tools to sell financing, buy cars, and operate better.

And this is the part I love the most:

Most independent dealers see big players as the enemy.
Kavak understood that fighting everyone is not scalable.

So instead of competing against the entire ecosystem…
they’re building infrastructure for it.

That’s why it’s called #kavakAliados.

⸻

3️⃣ The real endgame

It’s not about controlling inventory.
It’s about controlling the infrastructure of the market.

Amazon  didn’t win by owning every product.
Shopify  didn’t win by competing with every seller.

They built the rails.

⸻

And honestly, that’s exactly what inspires me.

At Dealcar , we’re building something similar:
technology + fintech infrastructure so dealers can sell faster, improve margins, and run a more efficient business.

Big respect to Carlos Garcia Ottati .
#Kavak is one of those rare companies that doesn’t just build a product…
they reshape an industry.

And watching them evolve is a reminder of why we started Dealcar  in the first place.

The future of used cars isn’t just retail.
It’s platform + services + financing.

And whoever controls that… controls the market. 🚗⚡","Carlos Horno Santacruz","activity","urn:li:share:7429774548750807041","2025-11-22","Valid 7429774550378393600","ACoAABRGMcwBGN7WHYQr_uTRAP2X3536fzhZytA","ACwAABRG","ACwAABRGMcwBUIYAqzx_5a6N6CqCgb15YxD_zlQ","ACwAABRG","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Hacía falta una solución como la nuestra, y por eso ya estamos cerca de los 500 concesionarios.

En un mundo donde la IA reduce las barreras para crear y lanzar productos, el verdadero moat está en entender profundamente el mercado, la marca, los partners y la distribución.

Eso es exactamente lo que hacemos en Dealcar.

vender un coche sin informar de una reserva de dominio activa es incorrecto.

Ahora bien, conviene diferenciar conceptos.

La reserva de dominio no es una “trampa”. Es una garantía real que permite a una financiera asumir riesgo y, gracias a eso, financiar a personas que de otro modo no serían financiables.❤️

Esta es la diferencia entre préstamo al consumo y préstamo auto 🚙

En caso de impago existe un bien concreto que respalda el préstamo.
Eso es precisamente lo que ha permitido que la financiación en el punto de venta (POS) se extienda tanto.

De hecho, convierte a muchos clientes “no financiables” en financiables, lo que dinamiza el mercado y genera acceso al vehículo.

Lo que sí es incorrecto es vender un coche sin haber cancelado la reserva o sin informarlo claramente.⚠️⚠️⚠️
Ahí entramos en falta de transparencia.

El profesional tiene la obligación de entregar el vehículo libre de cargas o, al menos, informar expresamente de su situación.
Y si no se hace, puede haber incumplimiento contractual.

Por eso algo básico:
siempre pedir informe DGT antes de comprar, seas profesional o particular.

Siempre veo el mismo debate:

“El renting es tirar el dinero.”
“Comprar es siempre mejor.”

La realidad es más simple:

Depende de cuánto tiempo vayas a tener el coche.

⸻

📊 Con un coche usado de 20.000€
(8% depreciación anual + costes reales + financiación 6,99%)

El coste real mensual ronda:
	•	Año 1 → ~367€/mes
	•	Año 2 → ~362€/mes
	•	Año 3 → ~357€/mes
	•	Año 4 → ~352€/mes
	•	Año 5 → ~348€/mes

Frente a un renting de 450€/mes.

👉 A partir del año 3, el usado financiado ya empieza a compensar claramente.

Y cuanto más lo mantienes, más se amplía la diferencia.

A 5–6 años, el renting puede suponer pagar ~100–170€ más al mes por comodidad.

⸻

Pero aquí viene lo importante:

🔹 Si quieres flexibilidad
🔹 Si cambias de coche cada 2–3 años
🔹 Si valoras cero riesgo y cero gestión

👉 El renting tiene todo el sentido del mundo.

Si tu horizonte es medio o largo plazo, el usado financiado suele ser más eficiente económicamente.

⸻

No hay una opción “correcta”.

Hay una opción correcta para tu horizonte temporal y tu perfil de riesgo.

Todos los modelos tienen sentido.

Solo tienes que saber qué necesitas.

———-

📌 Nota importante (cómo leer la tabla)

En el coche usado, el coste mensual no es la cuota del préstamo.

Se calcula así:

✅ Coste real = depreciación + costes + intereses
	•	Depreciación = lo que pierde el coche de valor cada año
(ej: si vale 20.000€ y pasa a 18.400€, has “gastado” 1.600€ aunque no lo pagues en efectivo)
	•	Costes = seguro + mantenimiento + impuestos + imprevistos
	•	Intereses = coste de financiar","Carlos Horno Santacruz","activity","urn:li:share:7427206629818937344","2025-11-22","Valid 7427248786390827008","ACoAABRGMcwBGN7WHYQr_uTRAP2X3536fzhZytA","ACwAABRG","ACwAABRGMcwBUIYAqzx_5a6N6CqCgb15YxD_zlQ","ACwAABRG","✅ Record Found","true",,false

El negocio bajo lupa 🔎

Si tu #concesionario o #compraventa se sostiene más por las comisiones de financiación que por el margen del propio coche, vienen curvas. El nuevo #Anteproyecto de Ley de #Crédito al #Consumo va a poner las cosas muy difíciles.

¿Cuál es el problema? Hasta ahora, la financiación era el ""cierre mágico"". Pero con esta ley, el control de solvencia será mucho más riguroso. 

Se acabó el análisis superficial; ahora las entidades tendrán que justificar con lupa a quién le dan el dinero para evitar el sobreendeudamiento.

Los puntos críticos para los grandes compraventas:

• Menos aprobaciones: Al endurecerse los filtros de solvencia, muchos clientes que antes ""pasaban"", ahora recibirán un ""no"" del banco.
• Adiós a la venta por impulso: Más burocracia y más transparencia obligatoria significan procesos más lentos. El cliente tendrá más tiempo para enfriarse.
• El negocio real bajo la lupa: Muchos grandes operadores han descuidado el margen de la unidad porque la financiera ""arreglaba"" el mes. Eso es una bomba de relojería.

La realidad es simple: Un mercado donde el coche no deja beneficio y todo se fía al ""extra"" de la financiación no es sostenible. 

Con los tipos de interés subiendo y el regulador vigilando cada contrato, toca volver a lo básico: el coche tiene que tener su propio margen. 

La financiación debe ser una ayuda para vender, no el respirador artificial del negocio.

OpenTrade Stablecoin Staking Yield, powered by Figment, brings the power of staking to stablecoins, combining SOL staking rewards with a hedge designed to neutralise SOL price volatility.

Here are 3 key features of the product👇

1️⃣ Yield is generated through a dedicated Figment run validator, accruing SOL staking rewards, paired with OpenTrade’s offsetting perpetual futures strategy

2️⃣ Crypto.com serves as the custodian and trading venue, with the custody account being fully segregated from the exchange

3️⃣ Customers can deposit stablecoins through OpenTrade or Figment’s application or API to begin earning interest immediately, and can withdraw any stablecoin amount at any time

Stablecoin Staking Yield can be integrated into treasury management strategies or into embedded yield products.

,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7405232695506681856","Yes","AI in litigation is extraordinarily powerful. But it needs to be used in the right way. 

From fabricated caselaw, to litigants in person showing up with their own ChatGPT created briefs, users, whether lay clients or senior attorneys, need to be educated about how to use these systems responsibly. Even using legal-specific AI tools requires training and understanding of how these systems work. 

We've seen that hallucinated cases are being drafted into precedent as example of AI-created caselaw, which then becomes caselaw itself! 

More than ever, it's critical to have systems that don't try to boil the ocean, but stick to retrieving information from a corpus of documents, not searching the internet or their training data. 

At Wexler we don't do legal research. Nor do we search the internet. We stick to the (incredibly time-consuming and difficult) task of extracting, analysing and organising facts for any dispute, in any jurisdiction. 

The economic value of this task is stratospheric. A single dispute can generate millions of documents. Associates spend weeks reviewing these documents. The smoking gun is rarely found. 

By grounding our system in the factual record, and painstakingly extracting each fact through a process of daisy-chained models, we have reduced the risk of fabrication. We ensure each user can verify every conclusion instantly. 

That's something we're proud of.

No Christmas jumpers, but a good ding-dong between barristers, partners and innovation lawyers about the future of AI in disputes.

A few moments that stuck with me: 

We discussed whether disputes could be prevented before they spiral: a ""fence at the top of the cliff"" rather than the ambulance at the bottom. 

If so, what role does the contract play? Perhaps AI-supported processes can map out early issue spotting and resolution.

The economics of legal work came up often. Routine tasks like drafting simple NDAs are becoming harder to charge for, while high-stakes matters depend heavily on factual precision and sound judgment.

One innovation lead noted she gets ten tech pitches a week but ""none focus on the facts"". This is precisely the gap Wexler fills. Most legal tools are broad assistants or help organise documents for disclosure. It was encouraging that we remained the expert's choice for complex disputes.

There is undoubtedly more friction in launching pilots on real data. But the pay-off is so much greater. The engagement from the users is up, the ROI can be benchmarked against how long it has taken to do things manually, and the feedback on the quality of the output is grounded in detailed knowledge of the subject matter.

As someone who works directly with international clients through Akiya, I want to share a story that reminded me of the good that still exists in our communities.

A retired couple from Australia purchased an Akiya in Wakayama. Their Japanese is limited, but their hearts are wide open. The wife once lived in Tokyo as an English teacher in the 1990s and had kept her Disneyland ticket from 1994 (see first photo below). Their dream was simple: a small countryside home where they could enjoy their retirement in Japan.

They viewed and purchased the home remotely through Akiya Air and finally arrived in Japan this fall to see it in person.

On the day I brought them to their new home, something felt off. The lot next door was now completely empty, even though a house had clearly stood there just a few months earlier.

As we tried to understand what had happened, the neighbor across the street came out and told us the truth. The house had burned down, and tragically a woman inside had lost her life.

It was heartbreaking news for anyone, let alone for someone visiting their newly purchased home for the first time. Then an elderly man arrived on an old bicycle and began surveying the land. He was the owner and the husband of the woman who had passed away. He had come to pay his respects.

We expressed our deepest condolences, and my client gave him a long, warm hug.

What happened next touched me deeply.

Despite their limited renovation budget, my clients asked if we could seek the owner’s permission to lay gravel and begin turning the empty lot into a small community garden in memory of his wife (see photos below).

He became emotional...and immediately agreed.

With the support of a local construction company, we have begun laying gravel. Our hope is to gradually transform this little space into something meaningful. A place where children can play, elderly neighbors can gather and chat, and where a husband can quietly remember his beloved wife.

This story will never be in the national news. It will not go viral. But I hope it serves as a reminder that beyond the headlines, kindness and community still thrive in unexpected places.

Regardless of our differences, foreign or local, Australian or Japanese, longtime resident or newcomer, we are all part of the same human family.

And our vision is for the world to live as one.

I wanted to share this, I think it might be useful for someone else too.

Six years ago, I was seriously ill. The prognosis was unclear, my condition unstable, and I had to dive deep into medicine on my own.

I learned to read bloodwork, studied dozens of research papers. And I hit a wall: there's just too much data. The human body is a complex system affected by dozens of factors. No single doctor can cross-reference all of it in their head.
That's when I first thought: when AI matures enough, this could work very differently.

Over the years of illness, I accumulated a massive dataset about myself. And now I've finally brought it all together into one system:
→ Blood tests & medical records spanning several years 
→ DNA test results 
→ 6 years of Apple Health data export 
→ Training logs, journals, photos, notes

I structured everything with Claude and turned it into a personal knowledge base. Then I started experimenting.

I generated a report, the kind a nutritionist would normally prepare. And it surfaced things no one had noticed before, because for the first time, genetics data and bloodwork were cross-referenced.

For example: I've always had chronically low levels of certain micronutrients. Supplements didn't help. Turns out I have a genetic predisposition and my body doesn't absorb standard forms of these substances well. I need different formulations entirely. No doctor had connected these dots.

I also calculated various metrics: biological age based on cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal and other body systems, a personal health index, and condition-specific indicators that are important to track given my particular health profile. The graphs turned out beautiful.

My plan now: validate everything with my doctor, set up minimal regular data collection, and build an AI agent that automatically pulls new data, searches for relevant research, finds correlations and sends me daily, weekly, and monthly reports.

The most exciting part? I built all of this in two evenings 

Right now, I feel like I’m holding two perspectives at once. One is pessimistic, that we might end up living like in The Terminator 😁  The other is that the quality of services and products is about to increase exponentially. The level of personalization and overall quality will grow dramatically in the near future.

It's not what happens to this industry. It's what this industry decides to become.

I wrote 40+ pages trying to answer that. Then I sent it to six people who see this differently than I do and asked them to be honest.

They were. No consensus. No easy answers. 
What came back was messier and more honest than either.

Now, a personal knowledge base with templates and routine automation.

My next step in 2026 is to build a personal intellectual infrastructure, and to create the same kind of system for my business.

Not a helper, but an environment that remembers context, learns from mistakes, and amplifies my strengths. On the one hand, I no longer need to write 30 emails every morning. I only review them. On the other, I have more time for deep research and for the real world, where information turns into practical knowledge.

After reading the news, one thought keeps coming back: Thanks for the free trial of 2026. I’d like to unsubscribe 🙂

For the past year, one question hasn’t let me go: How do I need to change, and how does my business need to change, given what’s happening around us?

If I simplify things, I see two strategies in the age of AI.

1. Go extremely deep in one domain.
 Create work with an almost irrational level of attention to detail. AI gives us back time, and that time can be invested in taste, intuition, judgment, and craft.
But this only works if you already have experience, perspective, and a very high internal quality bar.

2. Go massive.
We’re moving fast toward a world where intellectual and creative work becomes standardized, more like factories: speed, volume, repeatability.

Everything else sits in between and feels increasingly unstable.

So the real questions for 2026 are simple, but uncomfortable:
• What am I a virtuoso at?
• What do I want to be world-class at?
• Where is my true specialization?

The era of pure executors is ending. If your work can be fully described as an instruction, you’re already competing with AI. Looks like we’re all becoming entrepreneurs, whether we planned to or not.

🤝 Gracias, Hugo, por compartir este tipo de reflexiones tan alineadas con la realidad del VO. 

Que la principal preocupación sea la de mejorar los procesos internos, dice mucho de hacia donde vamos. 

Hoy muchos concesionarios están digitalizados, pero trabajan con una fragmentación excesiva de herramientas para gestionar el vehículo de ocasión: stock, leads, publicación, web, documentación, tasaciones…

En el caso de los concesionarios oficiales, además, existe una dependencia clara del fabricante que va más allá del VN o del taller.

También afecta al software que la marca impone, soluciones que en muchos casos no están pensadas para trabajar el VO como un negocio estratégico, sino como un complemento.

Y la realidad es evidente:
💡 El VO es hoy una de las principales palancas de rentabilidad del concesionario, más que nunca.

En Dealcar nacimos precisamente de esta idea: ordenar la operativa del VO, reducir duplicidades y devolver tiempo al concesionario para lo que realmente genera margen.

Si en tu concesionario das de alta un coche más de dos veces, ya estás perdiendo tiempo sin darte cuenta.

Me alegra ver que esta preocupación es cada vez más común en el sector.

At the Valencia Digital Summit , Pablo and I talked about something that doesn’t get enough attention: AI isn’t the main problem in healthcare. Data is.

You can build the most sophisticated model in the world — but if lab results come in different units, different reference ranges, different formats (sometimes even faxed…), your AI won’t scale. It won’t generalize. And it definitely won’t be reliable.

That’s the real bottleneck.
At OpenHealth Technologies, we focus on what comes before AI:
 👉 Harmonizing laboratory and diagnostic data
 👉 Aligning biomarkers across institutions
 👉 Creating a structured, comparable data layer that AI can actually work with

Because 70% of medical decisions are based on lab results — and yet this data is still one of the most fragmented assets in healthcare.
If we want preventive, personalized, AI-driven healthcare, we need to fix the foundation first.

Last week, I had the opportunity to share a keynote on a topic that keeps coming up in conversations with hospital and lab leaders:
Healthcare generates enormous amounts of data — but we still use only a fraction of its real potential.

While patients and clinicians are used to seamless digital experiences in other industries, healthcare data is often still fragmented across PDFs, legacy systems, and disconnected workflows. LIS, HIS, PACS, EHRs — all valuable, yet rarely speaking the same language.

Hospitals sit at the center of the healthcare ecosystem. They connect patients, physicians, labs, payers, public institutions, research, and innovation. That central role creates a unique opportunity — but only if data becomes accessible, interoperable, and clinically meaningful.

This is where we see a real inflection point.
With recent progress in AI and analytics, the challenge is no longer just data creation — it’s data harmonization, context, and usage. In our view at OpenHealth Technologies , the missing piece is a semantic layer for medical data: one that works on top of existing systems, respects clinical reality, and turns fragmented information into usable insights.

When done right, the impact is tangible:
• More efficient workflows and better decision support for clinicians
• Clear, continuous digital experiences for patients
• Interoperability and analytics that help hospitals and labs reduce costs and unlock new value

Transformation doesn’t start with big-bang projects. It starts with focused pilots, quick wins, and partnerships built on trust and domain expertise.

Grateful for the great discussions during and after the keynote — and excited to see more hospitals and labs treating data not as a byproduct, but as a strategic asset.

• Most results still arrive as PDFs

Enter OpenHealth Technologies, founded by Gerrit Glass, which harmonises more than 3500 biomarkers into one clean, comparable format used by partners like Roche, leading LATAM hospital groups, Aware, Youth, and more.

Yet most healthtech and longevity companies can't use it. [Ad]

Why? Due to a silent infrastructure problem no one talks about: billions of tests are done each year, yet they all come in fragmented formats (especially in Europe).

The same biomarker can be taken in different materials (blood, urine…) and can be reported in different units, ranges and formats across labs, even within the same country.

You can’t build personalised experiences on top of data that doesn’t align.

This fragmentation:
↳ blocks your AI deployment
↳ breaks longitudinal insights
↳ limits your ability to improve the customer experience

Building it in-house means:
↳ Months of dev time mapping fragmented lab results 
↳ Medical teams validating biomarker standards 
↳ Product launches blocked by missing infrastructure 
↳ Compliance headaches storing health data

And even more so, transforming it into real value that people and health professionals can use to improve health outcomes and build winning products and experiences is even harder.

That's what OpenHealth Technologies is unpacking in their 60-minute masterclass: “Transforming Lab Data into Value with AI”

What you'll learn: 
↳ Ingest biomarker data from any source — labs, APIs, PDFs, images 
↳ Why standardized data unlocks AI, personalization and longitudinal insights ↳ How leading teams saved engineering resources and boosted retention 
↳ Real examples from Aware, Roche, Oura, Function Health, and others 
↳ What's next in health data and AI deployment

At a legal tech conference in Germany, I was presenting Omnilex and our AI Commentary to a room full of lawyers.

After 15 minutes, I opened the Q&A. The usual questions came up, reliability, data protection, product roadmap. Then one woman raised her hand.

She first just asked a question. Then she challenged the premise.

Why aren’t you putting more focus on commentary, if this is one of the biggest pain points for lawyers?

Why is the structure not designed like X or Y?

What would it take for AI commentary to be truly usable in practice?

She kept going and turned the Q&A into a group discussion. Then shared her own vision of how AI commentary *should* look like.

After I went five minutes over time, I wrapped up the presentation and we had a 1on1 chat.

So, after Part 3, I was deep in the ERCOT data mines. The data is huge, but it is also a mess. The constraint names are just cryptic strings like ""HARGRO_TWINBU1_1"". No coordinates, no topology, just text.

My initial goal was simple: I just wanted to link these constraint names to the physical lines on the map so I could feed the geometry into Gridraven Claw and start monitoring them. But you know how it goes—I wanted to see how far I could push the model, so I kept adding layer after layer of complexity.
One thing led to another, and I accidentally created a preliminary grid model for the entire ERCOT interconnection.

The problem is that OpenStreetMap data for power grids is often… let’s say “creative”. Lines are broken, voltages are missing, and connections don't always touch. You cannot just use a standard routing engine.

So I built a custom system to solve it.
1) The Logic: I wrote a graph based ""Crystal Growth"" algorithm. It starts with one substation we know for sure, and then it looks at the neighbors in the grid topology. Like solving a massive Sudoku puzzle, it propagates outwards, locking in substations one by one.
2) The Physics: I wrote a custom ""Gap Jumping"" router. If the line data in OSM is broken (which happens a lot!), my script calculates the physics (voltage, distance, direction) and ""jumps"" the gap to stitch the line segments together.

Midway through debugging the algorithm (see the GIF of congested lines), I stopped and looked at the graph.

I realized I hadn't just found the locations of the constraints: 
1) I had the substations.
2) I had the transmission lines connecting them.
3) I had the voltage levels.

At this point, it is just a matter of pulling the power plant locations from the EIA official registry and plugging them into the graph nodes. Suddenly, you aren't just looking at a map; you have the foundation for a power flow model.

It is definitely over-engineered for a weekend project. But you know how it is. You start by looking for a few congested lines, and you end up with an intial digital twin of the Texas grid on your laptop.

Next step? Maybe I finally put this all into a dashboard. Or verify the conductor ratings with some weather data.

Our Dynamic Line Ratings customer, Fingrid Oyj, talks about how they validated Gridraven wind forecasts in this webinar in EPRI's GET SET series.

This is the breakthrough that makes sensorless Dynamic Line Ratings possible anywhere on the globe. Our vision is to boost grid capacity by 30% globally by 2030.

Even a light wind can double the capacity of an overhead line, but the transmission owner needs to be very sure that the wind is really there before allowing more power through the line.

When we say that the wind is at least 1 m/s at 3pm two days from now, then it will really be at least 1 m/s. The wind will not be lower than that with 99% certainty.

Accounting for wind cooling adds grid capacity up to half of the time.

After doing the PJM analysis, I was asked if it’s possible to do a similar thing in ERCOT since they also share a huge amount of data and use AAR.

So, I downloaded the 2025 real-time and day-ahead data and started digging. The scale is different here. I found roughly 1,200 unique transmission lines that were causing binding constraints in the grid.

Getting the raw data is the easy part. Making it usable is the real work. I had to map the constraint names to actual start and end substations and then query OpenStreetMap to extract the physical line geometries.

But geometry isn't enough. You need the physics. Since I don't have the operator's private asset database, I did the next best thing: I made my best (engineering) guess and traveled across Texas in Google Street View.

I think I did this year's vacation to Texas already by literally spending hours virtually driving down highways and dust roads to verify bundle configurations for the key corridors. I likely virtually drove past our CEO Georg Rute's home in Austin a dozen times, but I was too busy looking up at the transmission towers to stop and say hello.
It might sound a bit obsessive, but that is the only way to get the the main conductor assumptions right without insider info.

Long story short, I managed to clean the data and narrowed it down to the top 300 most critical lines by congestion cost to import into Gridraven Claw. Just like with the PJM experiment, I am now collecting the data to start running the conductor-finder brute-force tool to reverse-engineer the likely conductor types and operating temperatures that match the historical flow.

The good part? We are now effectively monitoring over $1 billion in annual congestion value continuously, with hourly updates and 60-hour forecasts. I have added a map to show all the lines we monitor in ERCOT and a sample 345kV line run by CPS Energy with forecasts.

It is nice to see what can be done with open data. Not sure if that is useful at all commercially yet, but at least it is great to see how the thermal models work and how well they correlate with actual market data

I am not sure yet if Part 4 will be about tackling another ISO or finally showing the validation results from the conductor finder, but let’s see.

After my first experiment (Harwood–Susquehanna 230kV DLR prediction) I’ve been digging deep into the 2025 PJM market data, and the numbers are staggering. Total congestion in PJM increased by over $840 million in the first nine months of 2025 alone—reaching a total of $2.23 billion.

I decided to map this chaos. I analyzed every 5-minute interval, mapped the congestion costs to specific substations, and identified the Top 100 most congested lines in PJM.

The Discovery
While doing the mapping, I noticed something that surprised me: a huge percentage of the highest-cost constraints aren't the massive 345/500kV backbones, but relatively short segments. For the engineers in the room: we know DLR isn't a silver bullet for every constraint. On long-haul lines, you usually hit Surge Impedance Loading (SIL) or stability limits long before you sag the conductor to its limit. But on these short, thermally-limited segments, the ampacity is the only thing standing between a clear path and a $1,000/MWh price spike. This is where AAR and DLR have the highest ""delta"" and the biggest market impact.

The Challenge: Beating the Market 
With FERC Order 881 now in effect, PJM has fully implemented Ambient Adjusted Ratings (AAR) into its congestion management. This means line limits now fluctuate hourly based on temperature.

My goal for Part 2: Can I use Gridraven Claw to predict these ratings for the Top 100 lines before PJM publishes them?

The Workflow
1. The Dataset: Focus on the 100 lines driving the highest congestion rent running in Claw.
2. The ""Inference"" Engine: Since exact conductor specs are rarely public, I’m using the brute-force tool from Part 1.1 to find the best-fit thermal parameters
3. Shadow Ratings: Running thermal models using only public geometry (OSM) and hyperlocal weather to generate a rating forecast up to 60 hours in advance.
 
Systematic Validation
By forecasting DLR/AAR for the Top 100 congested segments 24–36 hours ahead of the DA market clearing, we shift from reactive monitoring to predictive modeling of thermal constraints.

I am currently in the data-collection phase to establish high-confidence baselines for these specific line geometries. Once I have a statistically significant sample size, I will be conducting a formal back-test, benchmarking these ""Blind Predictions"" against the published PJM Day-Ahead ground truth.

Stay tuned for Part 3.","Henri Manninen","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7422306045642878976","2025-11-22","Valid 7422306045642878976","ACoAACIeBwoB7_6RpavNGuufqejPEcQFFCWUyDo","ACwAACIe","ACwAAAv0ez0BZApIq2ElCuWL8J78BRMjAT8JT1Q","ACwAAAv0","✅ Record Found","true","Response",true

In central parts of the country, solar and wind are above 25% of the fuel mix. Day-ahead power prices have normalized there, despite continual cold temperatures. 

But that affordable power is not traveling very far due to transmission constraints. For example, Kansas City and Minneapolis are surrounded by affordable power, but that affordable power is not getting in. 

Transmission constraints are especially visible in the nodes that have negative prices right next to Kansas City. Generators are probably trapped there and not turned on, even though that power would be needed in the City. 

Further, prices remain very high in PJM and NE-ISO that have only 8% and 6% solar and wind respectively in their fuel mix right now.

More transmission capacity is needed both locally to the cities, as well as across the continent to the entire North East, which is a densely populated area and where it's more difficult to site renewables.

The quickest way to add transmission capacity is by deploying DLR software on all lines. Gridraven is the world's largest DLR provider, and our solution is ready to be turned on. It would directly reduce congestion across the country and increase affordability of power.

A reliable power supply doesn't just mean that the lights will turn on when you flick the switch. It also means that it won't bankrupt you when you do.

But why, and what did it mean for batteries across the system?

ERCOT forecasted peak demand as high as 86 GW as late as 8 hours before Monday morning's peak. Actual load came in at just 75 GW.

Meanwhile, thermal outages stayed around 9 GW for the bulk of the storm, with the only major event being the forced outage of ~1 GW of generation at 8 PM on Sunday evening, which coincided with an emergency notice being issues for the loss of some transmission and generation in the Houston and San Antonio areas. 

ERCOT expected ~7.5 GW of thermal generation outages in the highest-concern hour according to its January 2026 Monthly Outlook for Resource Adequacy (MORA) report.

Renewable production was also roughly in line with ERCOT's expectations for a Winter 2026 Hour Ending 8 event. 

In its most recent Capacity, Demand, and Reserves Report, ERCOT projected intermittent renewable production just before 8 AM would be ~GW in an event like today's. 

As a result of the load forecast and generators across the system holding up under tough conditions, Day-Ahead Energy and AS markets priced in scarcity that didn't fully materialize in Real-Time. DAM energy hit $1,800/MWh for Monday morning, while RTM peaked around $1,000/MWh on Sunday evening.

Batteries remained nearly idle on Jan 24-25, maintaining a high state of charge, despite elevated prices on the 25th. 

Discharge peaked at just 1.7 GW on the 25th.

Then Monday morning: discharge peaked at around 7 GW, as operators who'd cleared in the Day-Ahead market executed their strategy.

Most batteries likely stacked Day-Ahead Ancillary Service awards throughout the weekend (which cleared above $100/MW, hitting $1,000/MW for RRS, ECRS, and Reg Up on Monday), allowing them to collect revenue with limited cycling requirements.

The most successful operators likely went even further.

On Sunday evening, with RT AS prices below $10/MW, they could have forgone those DA obligations, capturing the DA/RT spread, and discharging into the $750-1,000/MWh RT Energy peak instead. They then could recharge overnight at $250-450/MWh to meet Monday's DA commitments.

This kind of strategy requires precise DA market positioning, confidence in overnight price behavior, and willingness to charge at prices that would normally be prohibitive. 

Winter Storm Fern showcased how forecast uncertainty and a willingness to leverage a battery's flexibility create strategic opportunities. 

When Day-Ahead markets price in more scarcity than Real-Time delivers, the operators who can position accordingly (and maintain discipline through volatile periods) can optimize both system support and economics.","Brandt Vermillion","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7421611979230044160","2025-11-22","Valid 7421611979230044160","ACoAACRFE8wBNhByZJUDXkuhhSFXEroYuSP7MNI","ACwAACRF","ACwAAAv0ez0BZApIq2ElCuWL8J78BRMjAT8JT1Q","ACwAAAv0","✅ Record Found","true","Response",true

The winter storm has thankfully passed with the grid largely intact, but wild power prices are hitting consumers regardless.

In the image shown, day-ahead prices for Sunday evening in San Antonio are $1,600 per MWh. Just on the other side of the Spruce-Pawnee 345 kV line, prices are negative -$326 per MWh.

The price difference reflects generating capacity in the South that's just not allowed onto the grid. Generators are losing money while people are paying much more than they should.

Physically, the Spruce-Pawnee 345 kV overhead line would have at least 170 MW extra capacity at this time (dynamic ratings at 98% confidence, vs ambient ratings), which would almost certainly be enough to reduce prices in San Antonio. Compared with seasonal ratings, the extra capacity could be up to 500 MW. The value of this congestion relief would be up to $1 million per hour.

Throughout the weekend generation has been and continues to be trapped in the South, because of grid congestion that only exists on paper. This is not just a Texas problem, grid congestion is a problem nationally and globally, unnecessarily raising prices.

Even a light wind doubles the capacity of a transmission line by cooling it down. But that's not accounted for by transmission owners nor ERCOT. As a result, lines are limited more than they should be and the ""congestion"" does not reflect the physical reality of the grid.

Up until recently, wind forecasts were not reliable enough to account for the cooling effect, so grid operators had to assume almost no wind all the time. But that's no longer the case.

Gridraven has fixed wind forecasting and is the world's largest provider of software-only dynamic line ratings. With no hardware, this additional transmission capacity could be made use of. Grid operators in Europe have gone all in with this already. What's stopping us in Texas?

Austin will see -8°C (17°F) over the weekend, which is exceptional here. Minneapolis will see -26°C (-15°F). As a result of high demand, more expensive power plants are being dispatched that normally sit in reserve and the price goes up.

The image shows the day-ahead power price for Friday evening at 8pm CT. A large part of the country will see prices above $200 per MWh. For comparison, the below image shows prices for last week Friday at the same time when prices were only $30 or so. (Price maps from GridStatus, temperature map from Windy)

ERCOT, the Texas system operator, has stated that there is sufficient generation capacity available this time. Available capacity on Monday morning is projected at 94 GW while demand is forecasted at 81 GW. This is comfortable, as long as there are no unforeseen problems in the grid.

However, no blackout happens twice. It's always something new. For example, ice storms can lead to a buildup of ice on the optical grounding wire, which in a worst case scenario can sag and come in contact with a conductor. If that happens in a critical transmission line then it could lead to a cascading failure. Unlikely, and hasn't happened in Texas yet. Or?

This oversight is increasing reliability risks and costs for consumers.

If we start accounting for the weather's effect on the actual lines in transmission system operation:

1. Congestion becomes manageable

Weather-aware operations reveal unused capacity on constrained lines. Power can be routed when and where conditions allow, which causes congestion costs to fall. Ultimately, power becomes more affordable for consumers.

2. Prices reflect reality

Price spikes often reflect assumed scarcity, not actual system limits. Dynamic ratings unlock more accurate market price signals and create fewer extreme spreads between regions.

3. Reliability improves without new steel

During stress events, flexibility matters. Knowing what the grid can safely carry at that moment reduces the risk of shortages or cascading failures.

It also allows neighboring regions to help supply capacity when extreme conditions cause strain. This is especially critical as load growth accelerates and extreme weather becomes more frequent.

None of this requires new hardware or long transmission buildouts. A software-based approach can be deployed quickly, and scale across networks in a matter of months, not years.","Georg Rute","ugc","urn:li:ugcPost:7419401184404492289","2025-11-22","Valid 7419401184404492289","ACoAAAv0ez0BxJQjHkSBtwFYsLchwXcCBG3qUJo","ACwAAAv0","ACwAAAv0ez0BZApIq2ElCuWL8J78BRMjAT8JT1Q","ACwAAAv0","✅ Record Found","true",,false
,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7419089505745403904","No","tldr: My initial post might have bit understated how easy it was to guess/get line parameters. I started with educated guess, but then made a solution to brute-force it.

Testing random things, Part 1.1: How did you choose the conductor on Harwood–Susquehanna 230 kV line?

After my last post a few people asked the question that every engineer working with line ratings asks first:
“Ok… but how did you know what conductor to use?”

Fair question. If you get the conductor wrong, you can be very correct about the physics and still be offset by a couple hundred MVA. When modelling a line from public geometry (OSM) + weather, the conductor (and its operating temperature!) is the biggest missing piece. Operator documents exist, but they’re rarely public. So you either:
·     assume, and live with the bias, or
·     treat conductor selection as an inference problem.
I did the second.

Step 0 — make an explicit “initial guess” (and write it down).
Before fitting anything I pinned a baseline based on “what’s common at 230 kV in US” and what I could verify visually:
·     Conductor: Lapwing/ACSS (1590 class)
·     Max operating temp: 90°C (used a value commonly used with Lapwing)
·     Bundle: 1 subconductor / phase (Street View / photos)
·     Surface: ε = 0.9, α = 0.9 (yes, this is the part everyone argues about)
Then I ran the same thermal model + hyperlocal forecasts and compared the resulting time series against PJM Day-Ahead normal rating.

Step 1 — brute-force the conductor parameters.
Instead of guessing forever, I brute-forced a grid of plausible parameter sets:
·     possible conductor family candidates
·     max allowed temperature (set limits)
·     emissivity / solar absorptivity
For each candidate I recomputed the ampacity time series on the same limiting spans and scored it against the PJM series (error + correlation). The top scorer is my best-fit parameter set for this line under these assumptions.
No magic, no ML hype, it's just a dumb grid search and a score function.

Step 2 — the plot I should’ve shown in the Part 1 post.
I added an extra plot:
·     Black: PJM Day-Ahead (treated as ground truth here)
·     Orange: P50 with my initial guess
·     Green: P50 with the best-fit parameters

This makes the point obvious: the weather/physics capture a lot of the shape, but the conductor parameters decide whether you’re “close enough to be useful” or “nice academic curve”.

And why that is important?
Line ratings aren’t just engineering trivia. They change:
·     congestion patterns,
·     binding constraints,
·     and the effective capacity of paths you assume are “static” or only temperature related","Henri Manninen","activity","urn:li:share:7419021211558555648","2025-11-22","Valid 7419021214595141632","ACoAACIeBwoB7_6RpavNGuufqejPEcQFFCWUyDo","ACwAACIe","ACwAAAv0ez0BZApIq2ElCuWL8J78BRMjAT8JT1Q","ACwAAAv0","✅ Record Found","true","Response",true

Bei Scavenger AI sind wir weiterhin überzeugt, dass es am Ende nicht um KI geht, sondern um Probleme. KI ist ein Werkzeug, nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Wie jede andere Technologie auch. 

Ob wir uns gerade in einer Blase befinden oder nicht, ist dabei zweitrangig. Entscheidend ist, ob man ein reales Problem löst - und davon gibt es in Unternehmen genug, die heute konkret weh tun.

Firmen, die ""KI um der KI willen"" machen, werden es 2026 schwer haben. Firmen, die echte Probleme lösen, einfacher - mit KI oder ohne 😅","Maximilian Hahnenkamp","activity","urn:li:share:7417296347030253568","2025-11-22","Valid 7417475682848366592","ACoAABpXJsYBzja90Uu2bjEYHmtr7SWOZoW7NYk","ACwAABpX","ACwAABpXJsYBE-vZdrQoqE6hb-339AmUB2axhyI","ACwAABpX","✅ Record Found","true",,false

Denn gefühlt sitzen alle mit ähnlichen Herausforderungen da, haben aber komplett unterschiedliche Blickwinkel und Wege, sie zu lösen.

Mit dem Podcast wollen wir genau dafür eine Plattform schaffen, auf der Wissen, Erfahrungen und ehrliche Stories geteilt werden.

Für mich persönlich war es auch ein Highlight, in kurzer Zeit so viele spannende Menschen kennenzulernen und mit ihnen über ihre Herzensthemen zu sprechen. Das macht richtig Spaß und gibt mir selbst unglaublich viel Input.

Straight to code. Ship something. Repeat.

But speed doesn’t help much if you’re building the wrong thing in the first place.

The hardest part is still figuring out what problem you’re actually solving before you commit to a direction. That messy early phase where you’re throwing ideas around, comparing options, trying to get alignment.

And historically… that’s where continuity breaks.

You do all the thinking. All the exploration. User testing.

Then the handoff turns your design into a suggestion.

What gets shipped slowly drifts from what was intended.

That gap is basically why we started Flowstep.

intent → interface → implementation shouldn’t be three separate worlds. It should feel like one shared language.

This demo is a snapshot of where we are right now. 0.1% of our vision.

We’re early. Sometimes it breaks. We fix it.

But watching teams generate shippable UI in seconds, and stay in the same context from idea to shipped, is still kind of wild to me.

Great ideas begin in Flowstep. You can quickly ideate concepts, think faster, and keep your design in sync with code (but for real)

Design and code are the same thing in our canvas. It's easy to generate UI, export to Cursor, and then build it

A lot PMs and Designers avoid working directly in IDEs because there's no simple way to rapidly ideate

Fast ideation helps you visually communicate, test with users, and get aligned. That's how teams work

As a PM, I don't need a tool to build the full backend for me just for a proto I'm going to throw away. And most of the time, teams aren't building completely new products from scratch

Why people love the Flowstep <> Cursor workflow:

- Freedom to see multiple concepts at the same time on an infinite canvas
- Iterate live with your team using real-time collaboration
- Then when you're ready, you know the design you created in Flowstep is not a suggestion, it's what gets shipped

I will be attending the RWA & Stablecoins London Summit 2026 on 24 February at One Moorgate Place, London, organised by Ziv Keinan and @STG-3, bringing together leaders from institutions such as JP Morgan, BlackRock, Barclays, DTCC, Fidelity International, State Street, Mastercard and London Stock Exchange Group, among others.

Building institutional grade digital asset infrastructure requires multiple specialised providers working together within a coherent architecture. 

Custodians, tokenization platforms, wallet infrastructure, market infrastructure operators, compliance solutions and security tooling each contribute distinct capabilities. The summit’s agenda reflects this reality, spanning collateral management, regulatory frameworks, on chain marketplaces and cyber security for digital assets.

This is where Dedge Security fits in. We focus specifically on code security posture, helping institutions maintain visibility over risks at the smart contract and programmable logic layer. Our role is to support institutions and ecosystem participants in understanding and managing code level security exposure as systems evolve.

Themes I’m looking forward to engaging on:

- Governance considerations across tokenization infrastructures
- Code level risk visibility in stablecoin and RWA environments
- Institutional operating models for programmable finance
- Security posture as one component of a broader provider ecosystem

“The lab phase is over.”

- JPMorgan’s Kinexys processes large-scale institutional flows.
- Siemens uses blockchain for treasury operations.
- BlackRock tokenizes money market funds.

When client money depends on it and regulators are watching, this is no longer experimental infrastructure.

It’s production.
And production requires production standards.

This is where most institutions hit the same wall.

Point-in-time security does not scale in Web3.

Infrastructure changes constantly. Code deployments, permission changes, evolving dependencies. Weekly, sometimes daily. Yet most security models still rely on periodic audits, one to three reviews per year, with coverage that drops the moment the audit is done.

The outcome is predictable:

• Industry analyses consistently show that a majority of Web3 incidents occur after audits, between review cycles.
• The same issues tend to resurface across subsequent reviews.

As a result, a meaningful share of senior engineering time is absorbed by reactive remediation instead of preventive control.

In Europe, Web3 is only viable for banks when technical control is continuous and defensible.

There are no “Web3 operational standards” versus “traditional standards”.
There are only operational standards.

Risk committees do not care whether a system is blockchain or legacy. They care whether it is controlled.

The difference is not avoiding incidents entirely.
It is containing impact and being able to demonstrate control when it matters.

Without continuous security, Web3 is ungovernable.
And ungovernable infrastructure is simply not operable for banks.

The institutions scaling fastest are not treating Web3 as a parallel universe.
They are treating it as infrastructure that happens to use distributed ledgers, and governing it accordingly.","Olivier Laurette","activity","urn:li:share:7426640749653389312","2025-11-22","Valid 7426640750811185160","ACoAACqHtDoBPpTJnDFpGiKt55Kyx5nr8Sk7ax0","ACwAACqH","ACwAACFK554BznQQU5xFpi0hqxvCqzYIz9wNejQ","ACwAACFK","✅ Record Found","true","Response",true

➡️ Agentes Autónomos: Ya no se utilizan IAs que den respuestas sino agentes que completen flujos de trabajo de principio a fin.
➡️ Estandarización (MCP): La llegada de protocolos abiertos para que la IA acceda a datos de forma segura y universal.
➡️ Vibe Coding: Usar herramientas de IA para crear código en vez de que lo escriba una persona

We’re looking forward to joining industry leaders at the Digital Assets Forum this week to discuss how Web3 security posture management is evolving to meet enterprise demands.

As digital asset demand matures, traditional finance is moving to production.
But one critical gap remains: institutional-grade security.

At Dedge Security, we believe production-ready DLT needs production-ready protection — from code to chain.

We’re excited to announce early access support for DAML — the smart contract language behind the Canton Network.

DAML was built for regulated financial environments, where authorization, data visibility, and multi-party workflows are enforced directly at the application level. 

These guarantees are powerful,  but they also mean that security risk lives in application logic and behavior, not just infrastructure.

Until now, there’s been no dedicated security solution designed specifically for these ecosystems.

Dedge is changing that.

Our new release brings DAML-native security analysis to the Dedge platform, giving teams building on Canton visibility into security and correctness risks at the application level.

This makes Dedge one of the first Web3 security platforms to offer dedicated support for DAML, delivering:

✅ Code security and continuous analysis for DAML-based applications.
✅ Traceability, auditability, and compliance-aligned controls.
✅ Security built for production-grade financial networks, not experimentation.

When real value moves on-chain, security cannot be an afterthought.
And as institutional-grade DLT infrastructures evolve, security must evolve with them.

Some ecosystems demand higher standards.
We build for those standards.

If you're building with DAML or using the Canton Network, let’s talk.

And they do matter.

They surface edge cases and unexpected behavior that internal testing can miss. As a signal, they are useful.

But they answer a different question than governance.

They don’t explain how a risk reached production. They don’t explain why it was approved. They don’t explain who was accountable for the decision.
In regulated environments, “a researcher found it” is not an acceptable explanation.

Governance is about internal, verifiable control across the full development and deployment lifecycle. 

Ownership. Traceability. Evidence.

Because when you're dealing with customers logging into different systems to find that one big of information takes value away, it doesn't add value.

In #fieldsales and #salesforceautomation #crm demos on desktops just don't help teams who visit customers - they live on cars, trains and planes (I've been on 10 planes 🛩️  already in January) and they need a mobile first, voice first #userexperience #UX.

Why does that matter?

Adoption is through the roof with our mutual customers.

Je hebt flink geïnvesteerd in laadinfrastructuur op jouw terrein. Voor je huurders, bezoekers, bedrijven of bewoners. Maar nu het net piept en kraakt, blijkt dat jij als beheerder nauwelijks controle hebt over het energieverbruik van al die laadpalen.

🛑 Netbeheerders geven een ‘nee’ bij capaciteitsaanvragen.
🛑 CPO’s beheren de laadpalen, maar jij draait op voor de energiekosten.
🛑 En ondertussen: groeiende druk vanuit gebruikers om uit te breiden.

Met Tibo Energy’s EMS draai je dat om.
Wij geven jou — als beheerder van het energievraagstuk — de regie terug.

✅ Stuur het laadvermogen per paal via onze OCPP broker.
✅ Houd controle over je netbelasting, zonder conflicten met je CPO’s.
✅ Werk met je bestaande laadpalen: geen dure vervangingen nodig.

📣 Wanneer laadinfra jouw grootste zorg is, dan is er nu een oplossing die je eenvoudig kunt implementeren.
Zonder frictie, zonder langdurige projecten — gewoon slim aansturen wat je al hebt.

Dus:
Hey parkbeheerder — wie stuurt jouw laadpalen aan?
En durf je het antwoord aan?

💬 Laat je horen. Deel je situatie hieronder of stuur ons een bericht – we laten je graag zien hoe jij de controle terugpakt.

'Door het lokaal te houden wordt het oplossen van netcongestie simpeler en goedkoper' hoorde ik vrijdag wéér in het nieuws op BNR Nieuwsradio. En EnergyHubs is daar een mooi voorbeeld van!

https://lnkd.in/eWYcyfgY

Ambitie om te groeien, te verduurzamen of samen te werken, terwijl netcapaciteit steeds vaker de bottleneck is.
Daarom organiseren we op 26 januari samen met Jac Goorden een LinkedIn Live webinar over #EnergyHubs.
Niet als concept, maar als praktisch samenwerkingsmodel voor groei ondanks netcongestie.

We delen:
- waarom individuele optimalisatie tekortschiet zodra energie gedeeld wordt
- wat een EnergyHub nodig heeft om technisch én organisatorisch te werken
- hoe Kempisch Bedrijvenpark KBP congestie omzette in samenwerking

Onlangs kreeg ik de kans om mijn kijk hierop te delen in de Energietransitie-special van Het Financieele Dagblad. In het artikel ga ik in op hoe technologie kan helpen om met die beperkingen om te gaan, niet door alles anders te gaan doen, maar door energie slimmer aan te sturen.

Netcongestie vraagt om realisme, maar ook om een andere manier van kijken. Door vraag en aanbod beter op elkaar af te stemmen, kunnen bedrijven binnen bestaande aansluitingen toch stappen blijven zetten. Dat verlaagt kosten, vermindert frustratie en creëert ruimte in een systeem dat steeds voller raakt.

This isn't just about our smart EMS or the results we're seeing across Europe. 

It's about the problem we set out to solve, and the team that made it real.

Energy systems are getting more complex. More assets, more volatility, more constraints.

And most solutions weren't built for that reality.

👉 So we built one that was. A system that gives businesses control when the grid can’t. That proves orchestration matters as much as capacity.

Looking forward to sharing what we’ve learned at Tibo Energy Management Software and hearing how others are tackling the same challenges!

Perfect, I thought! I work in insurance, I can get this sorted!

However:

🗃️ I bought it on my Revolut card, which has insurance included on the Ultra plan. BUT it doesn't cover refurbished or used devices
🏠 So I looked into my home & contents insurance, but there is a variable excess of at least £500, it will affect next year's premium, and I'm reliably told that home insurance policies for low-value claimants often aren't renewed the next year*
🛠️ Lastly I went into three shops to see if I could pay for a repair, but the screen is niche and not a popular model, so the recommendation was to replace the laptop

*Home insurance is really broken right now. More posts to come on this

You know what would have been awesome? If CeX offered Loxa protection against damage and/or theft at the point of sale. Then I would already have a voucher for £1,100 to spend at CeX again, and everyone in the ecosystem would have won.

It's been a bumpy road, with departed (but still valued) co-founders, struggles to build early revenue, issues finding capacity, heavy FCA reporting as a consumer product, delayed product launches and a hard graft to fund funding. It took us a year to begin trading, and then a year to build serious revenue as we figured things out on the fly.

Insurtech is hard:

®️ you need FCA regulation (expensive, time consuming)
🤲 partners for distribution (challenging when you're still building the products)
💸 patient capital (hard when revenue is still low)
🖊️ underwriters to work with you (perhaps the hardest bit!), 
👩‍💻 tech that works perfectly, and 
👓 products that work (compliantly!) for the customer 

All at the same time!

There are only around 300 insurtechs in the UK (McKinsey 2025), and 20 or so fail every year. However we are now set up to scale under Erjon S.'s leadership as a full-stack MGA (with authority to underwrite and handle claims), 6 native product apps, a pipeline of over 80 retail prospects, 45 retailers already live, direct FCA regulation and able to underwrite 70+ insurable subcategories with amazing claim experiences for our customers.

Compared to my last venture (React News) which was profitable from day 1, this has been an humbling endeavour - but one that is all the more satisfying as it now starts to really click.

At times like this, I am exceptionally grateful for my Co-Founder Tori Hutchinson. She has been there since the beginning, working 70+ hours without complaint and persevering though a variety of roles spanning ops, compliance, partnerships, sales and customer service. She's an absolute hero and I'm very glad her efforts are finally paying off.

As a founder, the default mode is constant motion; chasing opportunities, putting out fires, trying to do everything at once. But speed without clarity is just noise.

Therapy has been transformative for me over the past year. It's helped me:

💠 Catch myself before reactive decisions derail strategic ones
💠 Distinguish between what's urgent and what actually matters
💠 Be present in conversations instead of already thinking three steps ahead (for no reason)
💠 Show up as a better leader for my team at Loxa

The work of building a company is relentless, but it doesn't have to be chaotic. Learning to pause, reflect, and recalibrate has made me sharper, calmer, and more effective.

I'm incredibly fortunate that my fiancée Dr Georgia Smith is a Clinical Psychologist who specialises in working with entrepreneurs and founders. While she's not my therapist (boundaries matter!), I've watched her build an impressive track record helping founders navigate the unique psychological demands of building companies; the isolation, the pressure, the constant decision fatigue, the imposter syndrome.

If you're a founder struggling to manage the mental load, or feeling like you're always in reactive mode, I can't recommend reaching out to her enough. She gets it (because she lives alongside it) and her clinical expertise is genuinely transformative.

Being recognised for service means a great deal to our team. It reflects the work we’ve done with our retail partners to raise the bar for aftercare and give customers confidence long after delivery day.

We’re looking forward to celebrating with the industry on 19 January at the NEC Birmingham.

You can find us at Stand 5-G70.

Thank you to our retail partners and to the Loxa team for the work that got us here.

“What is the best ecommerce platform?”

Dan Coleman from Coleman Marketing Limited says the real question is completely different.

Shopify is incredible… if you do not try to bend it beyond how it expects you to operate.
Magento is a powerhouse… if you actually need and can handle that power.
WooCommerce, BigCommerce, the rest… they all come with trade-offs.

There is no universal answer.
There is only cultural fit.
Your platform should match your ambition, your catalogue complexity, your team’s capability and your operational reality. Not just your wishlist.

The headache comes when retailers choose tech based on what they hope to be instead of what they are set up to do right now.

Platform choice does not define success.
Alignment does.

But as Dan Coleman from Coleman Marketing Limited puts it, profit is the only KPI that truly matters.

Because it is not the blended margin that keeps your business alive.
It is the reality at SKU level.
What does that specific sofa earn after returns, replacements, fulfilment, payment fees and acquisition costs.
What can your marketing spend actually sustain.
And are you measuring the contribution back into the business or the fantasy numbers that make a dashboard look good.

This is where retailers either scale.
Or suffocate.

Do you have the right to ask for the sale in the first place?

If your product is a basket-add on Amazon, why would a customer visit your dedicated website?
If convenience is your competitor’s edge, why pretend it is yours too?
If your proposition is not attractive enough, no amount of traffic solves the problem.

Dan has audited hundreds of sites. He can tell within minutes whether a retailer understands real shopping behavior or is living in fantasy ecommerce land.

It is not innovation to break what the customer expects.
It is not a strategy to ignore where the market is already eating your lunch.

I write this on my flight to New York for the final leg of what has been a productive, engaging, energetic, educational, and frankly pretty exhausting, trip! 

However, one thing is for sure. The buzz around legal and compliance transformation globally isn’t slowing down any time soon - and it’s a fascinating time to be right in the thick of it. Some of my observations:

➡️ There is increasing pressure across the board to optimise efficiencies and “use AI”; although exactly what and how to do so is still being discovered. The industry is constantly discovering, learning, and balancing historical operations with current day demands - and as service providers, we can help guide. 

➡️ Although the “Claude legal plugin” discussions aren’t going away, I’ve noticed a revised focus from law firms, professional services organisations and in-house teams alike towards integrating leveraging focused, point solutions which embed relevant technology into actual workflows. In any event, it is clear that close training and support is crucial to ensure the adoption and extraction of benefits from LegalTech tools

➡️ There is a strong appetite to collaborate with the right strategic partners to deliver even greater solutions and opportunities to customers - watch this space for some exciting announcements from Augmetec very soon!

🔨 🔩 A blanket “AI” solution isn’t necessarily the way forward. After all, you wouldn’t use a hammer to tighten a screw...right? So then why are we trying to use a “One Size Fits All” approach for complex workflows? 

The daily reality for lawyers across departments could not be more different. A tool designed for merger negotiations might be brilliant for Corporate, but utterly useless for an investigator hunting for a smoking gun in a 2 million email haystack 🔍 .

⚠️ This is the LegalTech Trap - deploying a broad tool that lacks nuance for a specific task, or bolting on a niche AI tool onto one part of a process, rather than across the entire workflow. This results in constant context switching, inconsistent processes, missed evidence and increased inefficiencies.

🎯 What changes this is a focused solution that understands the specific DNA of your workflow and implements appropriate technology across the board, end-to-end.

Last week on a factory floor, I overheard a conversation between an engineering manager and a purchasing manager that crystallized it:

“We don’t need AI to replace decades of experience. We need it to help us move faster - without compromising quality, and aligned with Europe’s trust standards.”

That’s the gap we’re filling at Resourcly. Too much manufacturing AI treats domain expertise as something to automate away. We see it as the foundation to build on.

European manufacturing and values are different:

➡️ Decades of embedded engineering knowledge
➡️ Complex, interconnected supply chains
➡️ Standards and compliance that matter 🇪🇺

You can’t solve that with generic tools built for different contexts, so we’re building AI that:

✅ Amplifies engineering expertise instead of replacing it
✅ Understands European supply chain & manufacturing nuances
✅ Reduces complexity while respecting what makes each operation unique

We’re not building another AI tool. We’re building AI that amplifies engineering knowledge, reduces complexity across portfolios and supply chains, and creates value through collaboration.

Because engineers, procurement, and supply chain teams don’t need replacing - they need intelligent partners that understand European manufacturing and work alongside them.

That’s how we build, too: with customers, partners, and inside our team culture - we don't just talk about it we act on it. 🧡

That’s the Resourcly difference. My co-founder Ian Draxten and I have spent 15+ years on european manufacturing floors - it’s why we chose to found and build in Europe, for Europe and beyond. 🇪🇺🌍

The kind of morning where you actually have space to think. Time for preparing the #boardmeeting next week. 

We've had an incredible start to the year at Resourcly - new talent joining the team, new customers trusting us with their journey. The energy is there. The momentum is real.

But today isn't about that momentum. It's about the pause before the next sprint.

And yes, there are numbers to review. Metrics to present. Updates to share.

But here's what I've learned: the real value of prep isn't in the deck. It's about those quiet hours of real reflection. 

Thinking through the strategic questions that actually matter. Identifying the topics worth a deep dive. Making sure we get the most out of the conversation.

Between the years, Ian Draxten and I already took time to reflect, prep and plan. We've done sessions with the team. That work is essential.

But this? This focused time alone, writing by hand, letting thoughts surface without structure - this is where the right questions emerge.

The most valuable meetings don't come from perfect slides. They come from asking the right questions.

Genau da setzt Resourcly an – wer ist dabei, wenn wir #Manufacturing #Data neu denken? ⚙️

Heute sieht es bei vielen Herstellern noch so aus:
 ➡️ fragmentierte Infrastruktur
 ➡️ fehlende oder unzuverlässige Daten
 ➡️ schlechte Datenqualität & Duplikate (z.B. „M12 Schraube“ vs. „Screw 12mm“)

Kurz gesagt: „Bad Data“ kostet Hersteller Millionen und blockiert den echten Nutzen von #IndustrialAI.

Was wir mit Resourcly bauen:
 ✅ vernetzte Daten und einheitliche Struktur über Standorte & Systeme – eine echte Single Source of Truth
 ✅ saubere, vergleichbare Daten als Basis für Entscheidungen & Industrial-AI-Anwendungen

Und dann wird’s richtig spannend – vor allem für die Supplier, die ich heute besuche:

🔥 Mit sauberen Daten können wir #Alternativen in Echtzeit aufzeigen. Gerade in Zeiten der #Nexperia Chipkrise ein brandaktuelles Thema!

Heißt: Unsere Kunden finden passende Komponenten schneller, reduzieren Komplexität und erhöhen Resilienz – und Supplier sind genau dort sichtbar, wo der Bedarf entsteht.

Heute schaue ich u.a. bei HARTING Technology Group, Festo, WAGO, SEW Eurodrive, WITTENSTEIN group, Phoenix Contact, Siemens vorbei.

We recently hosted an intimate customer dinner of our customers in and around the #Stuttgart area with a keynote on #GenAI in #SupplyChain from our angel investor Knut Alicke (ex-McKinsey Partner & Head of Supply Chain).
3 takeaways that stood out how we support our partners:

 ➡️ No clean, harmonised data - no AI impact.
 ➡️ Similarity in data and parts is an underused superpower.
 ➡️ Tail spend hides big savings through complexity reduction and supplier consolidation.

Identitet pekes ut som et av de viktigste sikkerhetsområdene, noe vi i Bsure er helt enige i. Imorgen har vi derfor planlagt et kort webinar, fredag 28. nov kl. 13. Det er vanskelig å beskytte det man ikke kjenner til, så her vil vi delerpraktiske eksempler og hvordan vi i Bsure jobber med:
 
 🔹 hvordan man faktisk får oversikt over sine identiteter
 🔹 avdekker risiko (vet du faktisk hvor mange som ikke har MFA?)
 🔹 prioriterer tiltak som faktisk monner

It was a crash course in how to build a company, it pushed us to think much bigger, and we did not know it then, but we pitched to the firm that we today welcome as our newest investor, Scale Capital.

At the time Bsure was mainly about saving money on unused Microsoft licenses. Along the way it has become clear that the real problem was much bigger, too many identities, too many permissions, and not enough visibility, especially around inactive and forgotten accounts. Today Bsure helps organisations close that visibility gap at scale, and the challenge is highlighted as one of the main areas to focus on in cybersecurity by Microsoft and highlighted in Gartner’s Identity Hype Cycle as an emerging area. For most customers, the total cost of using Bsure actually ends up being lower than doing nothing, because cleaning up unused identities also removes unnecessary licenses and software spend. Quite nice, right!

Since our last raise last summer, Bsure has grown to more than 200 customers across nine countries. With this new round, led by Scale Capital together with our existing investors, we will accelerate product development, grow the team and continue our international expansion. We are grateful to bring in an experienced investor such as Scale Capital, and excited to have them on board for this next phase. We now have a clear direction for where we are going, and we are focused on delivering even more value to our customers in the months ahead.

Thank you Zach and the East Carolina University community for getting the ball rolling two years ago, and for your continued support Matt, Mark and Michael. Your early belief and Pirates supporting Pirates mentality genuinely mean a lot ☠️ ☠️ ☠️

Not because people don’t care……but because reviewers are asked to make decisions with no context.

You get a list of users. Some role names. Maybe an “access level” if you’re lucky. 

And then the system expects you to magically know who should keep what.

So people guess. Or approve everything. Or spend hours chasing the information they need.

This is the part of identity governance no one talks about — the bit that’s meant to keep you safe, but often turns into an admin chore that achieves nothing.

This is exactly where Luna steps in.

In Ploy , access reviews aren’t just lists.They’re AI-generated decisions with the context you wish you always had:

🟢 Who actually needs the access (based on role, function, and historical patterns)
🔴 Who shouldn’t have it (department misalignment, unused accounts, over-privilege)
❌ Terminated employees with lingering access
📉 Accounts with no usage — even in engineering tools
📌 A clear explanation of why Luna recommends each action

And instead of forcing reviewers into a black-and-white approve/reject workflow, Luna frames each group the way humans actually think.

It turns a painful, time-consuming process into something reviewers can complete quickly and confidently — because they finally have the context to make real decisions.

For the final part of this little series, it’s time to shout about the two people who keep the commercial side of Ploy moving in the right direction — the people who make sense of the chaos and turn it into momentum.

Louise has come in and immediately started building the kind of partner ecosystem we’ve wanted from day one. She’s has the perfect blend of; deep channel experience and sharp commercial instincts

She’s already opening doors we simply couldn’t access before — and setting the foundation for what will become a major GTM lever for us.

👤 Iona Whyte — Revenue Operations Associate
Iona is the reason our GTM engine is becoming… an engine, not a collection of spreadsheets and good intentions.

She’s taken ownership of the whole commercial workflow — from how we track pipeline, to how we measure performance, to how the team actually executes day to day.

Calm, structured and absurdly efficient, she’s quickly become the person everyone relies on to bring clarity to the chaos.

These two have shifted the pace and professionalism of our commercial side massively — and we’re only just getting started.

One of the sneaky challenges in identity governance is that engineers often use personal GitHub accounts... which means their GitHub identity doesn’t always match the identity in your IdP.

That’s fine… until you’re trying to do access reviews, offboard someone, or figure out who actually has access to what.

🪄 This week Luna (our agent) started quietly fixing that 🪄 

In the background, she now spots unmatched GitHub identities and links them to the right employee

One of the coolest things about this stage of Ploy  is watching the product take shape in real time… and the people driving that are Berners and Ho-yon.

They’ve worked together before, know how each other thinks, and slot straight into that “we’ve-got-this” rhythm you can’t fake.

Berners spent 8 years at Multiverse, seeing the company go from early scrappy startup to a full-blown scaleup. He’s lived through the shift from “just make it work” to “make it work at scale” — and he brings that experience straight into Ploy.

Ho-yon joined us last week — but the impact of his arrival starts long before day one. He and Berners have worked closely together in the past, and you can feel it instantly: same pace, same wavelength... its epic to watch!

A semi-professional rugby player who brings the exact same energy into outreach that he does onto the pitch. Competitive, disciplined, and impossible not to like. Oli’s already set the tone for how we want to show up in-market.

Dan’s story is one of my favourites — he got into sales by phoning up cafés and local businesses after uni to sell his photography and videography services. Proper grassroots hustle. He’s brought that same creativity and drive straight into his work at Ploy.

But the headline figure of £100 million (which the minister herself calls “small compared to the billions being spent in the US and China”) still sends a risk-message: that this is a nice gesture rather than a full-scale bet.

In my view, there are a few important next steps:

1️⃣ The UK needs to show it’s happy to bet broadly on all forms of AI innovation, not just hardware. The ecosystem spans software, data pipelines, infrastructure, services, models and hardware.

2️⃣ Public procurement needs to become more streamlined, predictable and start-up friendly. At the UK Cyber Flywheel event this theme came up repeatedly! (shoutout to Alastair Paterson for hosting this). Government must act as a modern buyer of tech and not a slow legacy purchaser that select incumbent safety nets over innovation.

3️⃣ The message matters. Saying “we’re showing leadership” is fine, but if the backing remains modest, investors and founders might read it as “we’ll do something, but it’s not urgent”.

👊 This is a good signal, an okay start - but we need to do more to be able to compete on a Global scale and for the UK to truly become a destination of choice for AI innovation. 

If we want to lead the world in AI-enabled sectors like life sciences, financial services and cybersecurity, then the government needs to do more.","Jacob Prime","activity","urn:li:share:7397568783936282624","2025-11-22","Valid 7397568785420926977","ACoAABTE34MBXBeSbXVNoOLij5VLWF9eiPjPtJg","ACwAABTE","ACwAABTE34MBN-sAJ0GXptFw5yZN-KXlCpgig_s","ACwAABTE","✅ Record Found","true",,false
